        """
        this function is using "Forced Browsing" technique which is aim to access restricted areas without providing any credentials!!!
        it is used here to gain access to admin control panel by trying different possible combinations of links with the given URL.
        it's possible to do that and this a proof of concept that unserured cpanels with lack of right sessions configurations can be
        accessed just by guessing the right links :)

        the function takes those arguments:

        u: the targeted link which should be leading to the control panel, example:
        http://www.example.com/admin/login.php
        you have to delete 'login.php' and insert the rest of the link in the function like this:

        >>>import bane
        >>>bane.force_browsing('http://www.example.com/admin/')

        then the function will try to find possible accesseble links:

        http://www.example.com/admin/edit.php
        http://www.example.com/admin/news.php
        http://www.example.com/admin/home.php

        timeout: (set by default to 10) timeout flag for the request
        logs: (set by default to: True) showing the process of the attack, you can turn it off by setting it to: False
        returning: (set by default to: False) return a list of the accessible link(s), to make the function return the list, set to: True
        mapping: (set by default to: True) find all possible links, to make stop if it has found 1 link just set it to: False
        ext: (set by default to: "php") it helps you to find links with the given extention, cuurentky it supports only 3 extentions: "php", "asp" and "aspx"( any other extention won't be used)."""
