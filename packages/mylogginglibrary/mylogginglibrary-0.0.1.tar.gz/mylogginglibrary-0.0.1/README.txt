## Description
We studied the Logging module from the official python site, what it can do, what different messages it can produce, having considered different variants of logger construction, we wrote this code. For example, this involved identifying such features like logging levels(e.g., DEBUG, INFO, ERROR), formating options, log file destinations. Further it was necessary to publish all this in PyPI. To load it, we need to work with the command line, and the file where our logger body is located, namely, according to the instructions from PyPI add setup.py . Then create an account, pass the security methods (two factor authorization and creation of a token) with the help of which the upload to PyPI is made.
