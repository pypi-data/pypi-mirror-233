# Python Advanced Typing

## Overview

### Description

`python-advanced-typing` is a simple Python package to help developers validate the types of variables in their codebase. With support for checking individual variables or multiple variables at once, it offers a concise way to ensure that the data you're working with meets your expectations.
### Features
- **Single Variable Check**: Compare a variable's type against a specific type or multiple acceptable types.
- **Bulk Verification**: Validate the types of multiple variables simultaneously using a list.
## Setup Instructions
**Install the Package using**:

```
pip install python-advanced-typing
```

## Usage
### Check Individual Variable
```python
from python_advanced_typing import check_type

x = "Hello"
check_type(x, "x", str)
```
### Bulk Check Multiple Variables
```python
from python_advanced_typing import check_type

x = "Hello"
y = 123
z = [1, 2, 3]

check_type(
    (x, "x", str),
    (y, "y", int),
    (z, "z", list)
)
```
