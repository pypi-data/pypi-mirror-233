## File Format Specifications
### Student file
The file(.txt) with student names should be designed in the following way:
```
# Teaching assistant (information)
first_name lastname (unique_student_id)
first_name lastname (unique_student_id)
```
Text after '#' can be arbitrary since lines with '#' will be skipped. First names with spaces must be connected with "_".
There is an [example student file](teststudenten.txt) available. 

### Feedback form
The file(.toml) with feedback should be designed in the following way:
```
["Section 1"]
Unique_id = "Feedbackline 1"
Unique_id = "Feedbackline 2"
Unique_id = "Feedbackline 3" 
Unique_id = "Feedbackline 4"

["Section 2"]
Unique_id = "Feedbackline 1"
Unique_id = "Feedbackline 2"
Unique_id = "Feedbackline 3"
Unique_id = "Feedbackline 4"

```
The unique IDs must be unique within the feedback form.
