Consulting and more
===================

If you need a help in design, conducting and interpretation of label experiments, you can expose your problem in a brief email to platform MetaToul-Réseaux-Métaboliques (metatoul [at] insa-toulouse [dot] fr) located in Toulouse, France. A dedicated person will take contact with your to detail what can be done to help you and to draw up a quote.
For more details about the platform MetaToul, you can visit their `web site <http://www.metatoul.fr>`_ (english version is available).

If you need help in topics related to mathematics, ``influx_si`` software itself or custom feature for ``influx_si``, you can ask a project creation with Mathematics Cell in Toulouse Biotechnology Institute (sokol (at) insa-toulouse (dot) fr).

You don't have to ask for a consulting for a simple bug submission. A bug submission can be directly made at `github <https://github.com/sgsokol/influx/issues>`_

If you wish to be informed about new influx_si releases and/or have discussions with influx_si users, you can subscribe to a dedicated email list `[influx_si] <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/influx_si>`_
