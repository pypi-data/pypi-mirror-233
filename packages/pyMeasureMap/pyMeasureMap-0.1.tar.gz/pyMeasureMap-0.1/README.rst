============
pyMeasureMap
============


    Python implementation of the MeasureMap specification


Usage
=====

#. Clone the repository
#. Install the package:

   * If you only want to use the package, install it with pip::

       pip install .

     (where `.` stands for the directory with your local clone)

   * If you want to run the tests::

       pip install ".[testing]"

   * If you want to contribute, make sure to include `-e` (for editable) and run::

       pip install -e ".[dev]"

Running all tests
-----------------

To run the tests you need a clone of the `aligned_bach_chorales`_ repository. By default, it will be cloned into your
home directory under ``~/git``. To set it up yourself:

   * Clone `aligned_bach_chorales`_ (submodules not required)
   * Point pyMeasureMap's tests to the directory of the clone by setting the constant ``REPOSITORY_PATH`` to the
     directory that includes the ``aligned_bach_chorales`` directory.

To run the tests, head to your pyMeasureMaps clone and run ``tox``.

.. _aligned_bach_chorales: https://github.com/measure-map/aligned_bach_chorales

Command line interface
----------------------

Once the package is installed, the ``MM`` will be available in your commandline. Typing it will print the available
sub-commands.

Extracting measure maps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Type ``MM extract -h`` to print the help with all arguments.

Parsing all files in ``path/to/chorales`` that music21 can parse::

    MM extract -d path/to/corpus                    # creates measure maps next to the parsed files
    MM extract -d path/to/corpus -o path/to/output  # creates measure maps in the specified directory
    MM extract -d path/to/corpus -r "^bwv"          # only parses files that match the regex (i.e., start with "bwv")
    MM extract -d path/to/corpus -x .mxl .xml       # only parses files with the specified extensions

Loading and writing
-------------------


.. code-block:: python

   mm = MeasureMap.from_json_file("path/to/file.mm.json")
   mm.to_json_file("path/to/new_file.mm.json")

Compress a MeasureMap object
----------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   mm = MeasureMap.from_json_file("path/to/file.mm.json")
   compressed = mm.compress()
   compressed.to_json_file("path/to/compressed.mm.json")

This project uses `pre-commit`_, please make sure to install it before making any
changes::

    pip install pre-commit
    cd pyMeasureMap
    pre-commit install

It is a good idea to update the hooks to the latest version::

    pre-commit autoupdate

Don't forget to tell your contributors to also install and use pre-commit.
