## Thanks🙏

Very thanks to the project [LrcParser](https://gitee.com/thecasttim/lrc-parser) of [thecasttim](https://gitee.com/thecasttim). It had given us so much reference to our project, we could say, the project LyricLib now is based on the project LrcParser to build.

The original author _thecasttim_ had referenced the following projects, here we'll show them out, too.

+ `python 根据歌词的时间（LRC文件），生成H5 audio按句播放器`
