<h1> Parts and Overlaps </h1>
A logic problem by <b>Adam Richard-Bollans</b>
<p>

Your problem is to use <i>first-order logic</i> to represent the 
following example of reasoning, and use 
the <i>Prover9</i> theorem prover to prove that the
reasoning is valid.

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>

<b>A1:</b> An axiom for Contact: Contact is reflexive.
<p>
<b>A2:</b> Definition of Parthood: A region, A, is part of a region, B,  if and only if whenever a region, C, is in contact with A then it is in contact with B.
<p>
<b>A3:</b> Definition of Proper Parthood: A region A is a proper part of a region B if and only if A is part of B but B is not part of A.
<p>
<b>A4:</b> Definition of Overlap: A region A overlaps a region B if and only if there is a region which is part of both region A and B.
<p>
<b>Goal:</b> If any region A is a proper part of any region B then A overlaps B and A is in contact with B.
