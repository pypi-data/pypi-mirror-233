<p><b>Outline: </b>The domain is crumpets. I have four crumpets on a plate. Two are honey crumpets and the other two just butter. I can eat two crumpets but must leave two for my freind. Of course, I want to have at least one of the Honey crumpets. But unfortunately, the warm honey has run into the crumpets, and I can't tell, or remember, which are the honey ones. :( However, I do remember that the two honey crumpets were next to each other.
