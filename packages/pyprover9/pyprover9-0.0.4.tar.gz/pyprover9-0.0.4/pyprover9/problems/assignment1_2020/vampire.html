<h1> The Missing Reflection </h1>
A logic puzzle by <b>Brandon Bennett</b>
<p>

Your problem is to use <i>first-order logic</i> to represent the 
following example of reasoning, and use 
the <i>Prover9</i> theorem prover to prove that the
reasoning is valid.
<p>
Use the following template file to create your
Prover9 encoding of the problem:

<p><b>Outline: </b>
                 One dark and stormy night the residents of Abbey House, Whitby were sitting
                 down for an elaborate but unappetising dinner in the large dining hall. 
                 Sir Hugh Cholmeley,
                 Lady Anne, Master Bram and Dr Burely all looked pale and unwell.
                 None had slept well for weeks.
                 On the wall next to the table was a large mirror, which reflected
                 the scene of the meal and the diners. Can you use knowledge
                 representation in first-order logic and automated reasoning
                 to find who or what is causing sleepless nights at Abbey House?

<h4>Notes:</h4>
<ul>
<li>* The mirror was old and the dining room was dimly lit
                         by flickering candles. She could see the reflection
                        of the group of diners, but could not tell how many
                        there were, or what each was wearing. However, she could see
                        that among the whole group, only two different colours
                        were being worn.
                    </li>
<li>** You cannot express this directly in the given non-logical vocabulary. Instead you
                     should write a simple formula that it directly implies, which can be expressed
                     in the given vocabulary.</li>
<li>*** For the goal, you should give a proposition asserting 
                        this for a specific person X. This goal should be provable from
                        the assumptions, if they are represented correctly.</li>
</ul>
