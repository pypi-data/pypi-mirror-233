# Simple-Python-Telnet-Server
Simple module that allows to receive and send messages to clients through Telnet.

It is a generalized version of https://github.com/Frimkron/mud-pi made by 
Mark Frimston.

# How to use
You can learn to use it by reading the docstrings of the public methods
in TelnetServer, or by looking at some examples. The echo_telnet_server.py file 
under the examples directory is a simple server that makes use of all of the 
PythonServer features, so it is a perfect place to learn.

# Author
TelnetServer was created by Oliver L. Sanz, using Mark Frimston's mud-pi server
as the working base.
