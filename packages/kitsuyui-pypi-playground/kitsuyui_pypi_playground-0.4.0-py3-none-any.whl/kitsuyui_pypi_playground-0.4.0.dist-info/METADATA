# pypi-playground

## What is this?

This is a repository for creating sample code for publishing to PyPI.
I manage multiple Python projects, but the configuration for publishing them to PyPI is almost the same.
In this playground, I experiment with them, and configure them to speed up CI and make project management easier.
