# Welcome to Temperature Response Functions

This is a small package for estimating wheat yield. it estimates yield under non-stressed and VPD stressed conditions as a function of temperature.

## Quick start

The package for temperature response functions can be installed with `pip`:

``` sh
pip install tfunct
```
