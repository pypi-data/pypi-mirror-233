# OHNLP Toolkit Cross-Language Python Bridge
This repository contains the python bridge and associated API to implement python-based components for the OHNLP Toolkit.
For most users, direct usage of this git repository should not be necessary unless implementing your own
python-based backbone component, in which case this module should be installed via `pip install ohnlp-backbone-xlang-python`
and the relevant API functions correspondingly implemented.

For example Backbone python module implementations of the relevant API functions, please refer to the 
[Backbone-XLang-Python-Examples](https://github.com/OHNLP/backbone-xlang-python-examples) repository instead
