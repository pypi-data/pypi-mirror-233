## Typing stubs for requests

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `requests` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`requests`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/requests. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

Note: `types-requests` has required `urllib3>=2` since v2.31.0.7. If you need to install `types-requests` into an environment that must also have `urllib3<2` installed into it, you will have to use `types-requests<2.31.0.7`.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `011f24794d334ecbd6bda104a8e57399bd6bcad8` and was tested
with mypy 1.5.1, pyright 1.1.328, and
pytype 2023.8.31.
