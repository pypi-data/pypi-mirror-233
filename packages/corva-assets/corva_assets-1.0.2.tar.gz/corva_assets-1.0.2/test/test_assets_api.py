    Corva API

    The Corva API is a powerful interface providing great flexibility and extensibility with Corva. Whether your needs are simple UI visualizations, data entry, replication/sync tasks, real-time stream processing, or complex machine learning CPU-intensive apps, the Corva API is the way to make it happen. Our concepts are split into three distinct silos: data apps, visualization apps, and a REST API
