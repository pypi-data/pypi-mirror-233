A Basic Python PID Controller For Discrete Time Regulators

**Basic PID** is a classic PID controller that is easy to use, works and does the job.

The PID controller implements timestep integration
that is designed to be used in discretized time regulators.

**Basic PID** has proven to be a tested, and reliable PID controller. It has been used, for example, 
with mobile robotic systems for LVC (Linear Velocity Control) for regulating wheel velocities, 
LVDR (Lateral Velocity Differential Regulator) for keeping the wheel velocities in sync for 
differential drive mobile robots when traversing a straight line path and 
ADVR (Angular Differential Velocity Regulator) for tracking a heading angle using typical
motion control input signals (v,w) for linear & angular velocities.

It supports 2 modes of operation: **Integrative** and **Iterative**

In **iterative mode**, the timestep integration for updating an input
signal is done in the algorithm that calls the PID controller
for the ouput of the PID at the current timestep.

In **integrative mode**, the timestep integration is done inside the
controller and the output from the PID controller for the
current timestep is used directly to be sent to the process plant
as the current input signal.

Installation: 

$ **pip** install basic-pid
