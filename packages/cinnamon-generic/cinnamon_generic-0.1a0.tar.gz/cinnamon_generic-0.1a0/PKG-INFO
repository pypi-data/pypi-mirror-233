# Cinnamon Generic 

The generic package offers several ``Component`` and related ``Configuration`` for machine-learning.

Additionally, it provides the first set of **commands**: high-level APIs for speeding up cinnamon registration.

## Documentation

Check the online documentation of [cinnamon-generic](https://nlp-unibo.github.io/cinnamon_generic/) for more information.

Check also the central [cinnamon](https://nlp-unibo.github.io/cinnamon/) documentation to overview all cinnamon packages!


## Components and Configurations


The generic package defines ``Component`` and ``Configuration`` for

- Hyper-parameter calibration
- Callbacks
- Data loaders
- Data splitters (e.g., train, validation and test)
- File manager
- Framework helper (e.g., for deterministic runs)
- Metrics
- Model API
- Pipeline API (i.e., a special nested ``Component`` that executes children sequentially)
- Data processors
- Model validation routines: train and test, cross-validation

## Commands

Commands are syntactic sugar for several cinnamon operations.

For instance, the ``setup_registry()`` performs (i) custom module loading; (ii) registration DAG evaluation and (iii) registration.
Thus, it is just necessary to invoke this command at the beginning of each runnable script to use cinnamon.

Other commands are more specific to the generic package:

- Running a generic ``Component``.
- Running a ``Routine`` component in **training** and **inference** modes.
- Running multiple ``Component`` in sequential fashion.
- Running multiple ``Routine`` components in sequential fashion.
- Running a ``Calibrator`` component.

## Install

pip

      pip install cinnamon-generic

git

      git clone https://github.com/federicoruggeri/cinnamon_generic
