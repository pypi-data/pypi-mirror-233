## About

Being a student in this day and age means constantly having to keep up to date with the files that are uploaded to the student portal. I needed a tool that would take care of retrieving these files for me, allowing me to focus on the work to be done. Something I could set up and forget about.



What I was looking for in such an application was:

- Automatic syncing with minimal intervention after the initial setup
- Graphical interface
- Cross-platform compatibility
- It would make use of the [Blackboard REST API][blackboard-api]

### 30+ Universities Supported Around the World
