1. What are the key components of a power analysis, and how do they interact to determine the required sample size for a study?

A: minimum detectable effect size, significance level, desired power, standard deviation and sample size

2. Describe the trade-off between Type I and Type II errors in hypothesis testing and how it relates to power analysis. 

Type I error (alpha) is the probability of rejecting a null hypothesis when it is actually true. In other words, it's a false positive. Lowering Î± makes it harder to declare an effect statistically significant, reducing the risk of false positives but increasing the risk of false negatives.

Type II Error (beta): This is the probability of failing to reject a null hypothesis when it is actually false. It's a false negative. Power (1 - beta) is the complementary probability, and it represents the likelihood of correctly detecting an effect when it truly exists.
