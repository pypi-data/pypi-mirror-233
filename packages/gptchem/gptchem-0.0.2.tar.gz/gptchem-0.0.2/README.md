Use GPT-3 to solve chemistry problems.
Most of the repo is currently not intended for use as library but as documentation of our experiments. 
We'll factor out the experiments (that come with tricky dependencies) into its own repository over time.

## üí™ Getting Started

```python 
from gptchem.gpt_classifier import GPTClassifier 
from gptchem.tuner import Tuner 

classifier = GPTClassifier(
    property_name="transition wavelength", # this is the property name we will use in the prompt template
    tuner=Tuner(n_epochs=8, learning_rate_multiplier=0.02, wandb_sync=False),
)

classifier.fit(["CC", "CDDFSS"], [0, 1])
predictions = classifier.predict(['CCCC', 'CCCCCCCC'])
```

## üöÄ Installation

<!-- Uncomment this section after your first ``tox -e finish``
The most recent release can be installed from
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/gptchem/) with:

```bash
$ pip install gptchem
```
-->

The most recent code and data can be installed directly from GitHub with:

```bash
$ pip install git+https://github.com/kjappelbaum/gptchem.git
```

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers

The final section of the README is for if you want to get involved by making a code contribution.

### Development Installation

To install in development mode, use the following:

```bash
$ git clone git+https://github.com/kjappelbaum/gptchem.git
$ cd gptchem
$ pip install -e .
```

### ü•º Testing

After cloning the repository and installing `tox` with `pip install tox`, the unit tests in the `tests/` folder can be
run reproducibly with:

```shell
$ tox
```

Additionally, these tests are automatically re-run with each commit in a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/kjappelbaum/gptchem/actions?query=workflow%3ATests).

### üìñ Building the Documentation

The documentation can be built locally using the following:

```shell
$ git clone git+https://github.com/kjappelbaum/gptchem.git
$ cd gptchem
$ tox -e docs
$ open docs/build/html/index.html
``` 

The documentation automatically installs the package as well as the `docs`
extra specified in the [`setup.cfg`](setup.cfg). `sphinx` plugins
like `texext` can be added there. Additionally, they need to be added to the
`extensions` list in [`docs/source/conf.py`](docs/source/conf.py).

### üì¶ Making a Release

After installing the package in development mode and installing
`tox` with `pip install tox`, the commands for making a new release are contained within the `finish` environment
in `tox.ini`. Run the following from the shell:

```shell
$ tox -e finish
```

This script does the following:

1. Uses [Bump2Version](https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version) to switch the version number in the `setup.cfg`,
   `src/gptchem/version.py`, and [`docs/source/conf.py`](docs/source/conf.py) to not have the `-dev` suffix
2. Packages the code in both a tar archive and a wheel using [`build`](https://github.com/pypa/build)
3. Uploads to PyPI using [`twine`](https://github.com/pypa/twine). Be sure to have a `.pypirc` file configured to avoid the need for manual input at this
   step
4. Push to GitHub. You'll need to make a release going with the commit where the version was bumped.
5. Bump the version to the next patch. If you made big changes and want to bump the version by minor, you can
   use `tox -e bumpversion minor` after.

This package was created with [@audreyfeldroy](https://github.com/audreyfeldroy)'s
[cookiecutter](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter) package using [@cthoyt](https://github.com/cthoyt)'s
[cookiecutter-snekpack](https://github.com/cthoyt/cookiecutter-snekpack) template.
