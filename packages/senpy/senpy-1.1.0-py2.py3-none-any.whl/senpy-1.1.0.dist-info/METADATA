Senpy lets you create sentiment analysis web services easily, fast and using a well known API.
As a bonus, Senpy services use semantic vocabularies (e.g. `NIF <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/>`_, `Marl <http://www.gsi.upm.es/ontologies/marl>`_, `Onyx <http://www.gsi.upm.es/ontologies/onyx>`_) and formats (turtle, JSON-LD, xml-rdf).

Have you ever wanted to turn your sentiment analysis algorithms into a service?
With Senpy, now you can.
It provides all the tools so you just have to worry about improving your algorithms:

Installation
------------
The stable version can be installed in three ways.

Through PIP
***********

.. code:: bash

   pip install -U --user senpy

   
Alternatively, you can use the development version:
 
.. code:: bash

   git clone http://github.com/gsi-upm/senpy
   cd senpy
   pip install --user .

If you want to install Senpy globally, use sudo instead of the ``--user`` flag.

Docker Image
************
Build the image or use the pre-built one: ``docker run -ti -p 5000:5000 gsiupm/senpy``.

To add custom plugins, add a volume and tell Senpy where to find the plugins: ``docker run -ti -p 5000:5000 -v <PATH OF PLUGINS>:/plugins gsiupm/senpy -f /plugins``


Compatibility
-------------

Senpy should run on any major operating system.
Its code is pure Python, and the only limitations are imposed by its dependencies (e.g., nltk, pandas).

Currently, the CI/CD pipeline tests the code on:

* GNU/Linux with Python versions 3.7+ (3.10+ recommended for all plugins)
* MacOS and homebrew's python3
* Windows 10 and chocolatey's python3

The latest PyPI package is verified to install on Ubuntu, Debian and Arch Linux.

If you have trouble installing Senpy on your platform, see `Having problems?`_.

Developing
----------

Running/debugging
*****************
This command will run the senpy container using the latest image available, mounting your current folder so you get your latest code:

.. code:: bash


    # Python 3.5
    make dev
    # Python 2.7
    make dev-2.7

Building a docker image
***********************

.. code:: bash


    # Python 3.5
    make build-3.5
    # Python 2.7
    make build-2.7

Testing
*******

.. code:: bash


    make test

Running
*******
This command will run the senpy server listening on localhost:5000

.. code:: bash


    # Python 3.5
    make run-3.5
    # Python 2.7
    make run-2.7

Usage
-----

However, the easiest and recommended way is to just use the command-line tool to load your plugins and launch the server.

.. code:: bash


   senpy

or, alternatively:

.. code:: bash


    python -m senpy


This will create a server with any modules found in the current path.
For more options, see the `--help` page.

Alternatively, you can use the modules included in Senpy to build your own application.

For more information, check out the `documentation <http://senpy.readthedocs.org>`_.

Python 2.x compatibility
------------------------

Keeping compatibility between python 2.7 and 3.x is not always easy, especially for a framework that deals both with text and web requests.
Hence, starting February 2019, this project will no longer make efforts to support python 2.7, which will reach its end of life in 2020.
Most of the functionality should still work, and the compatibility shims will remain for now, but we cannot make any guarantees at this point.
Instead, the maintainers will focus their efforts on keeping the codebase compatible across different Python 3.3+ versions, including upcoming ones.
We apologize for the inconvenience.


Having problems?
----------------

Please, file a new issue `on GitHub <https://github.com/gsi-upm/senpy/issues>`_ including enough details to reproduce the bug, including:

* Operating system
* Version of Senpy (or docker tag)
* Installed libraries
* Relevant logs
* A simple code example
