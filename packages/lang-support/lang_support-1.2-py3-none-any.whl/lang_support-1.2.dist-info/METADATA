## My python program that allows you to use multiple languages in your own programs

Package is <b>LangSupport</b> in lang_support.py file.<br><br>

<b>main.py</b> file, in example directory, is an example of use<br>

Tu run example:
```bash
cd lang_support
py -m example.main
```
<br>
Also there is <b>with_data_logger</b> directory, which is the same LangSupport class but print functions were changed to logging functions (to enable logging output to file instead of standard output)<br><br>

### <b>generate_translation.py</b> file is a script which read one language file and generate translation for selected language (deepl package and token needed)

### I will add option to generate lang files soon
