# Labeller

Quickly set up an image labelling web application for the tagging of images by humans for supervised machine learning tasks.

## Introduction

*Labeller* allows you to quickly set up an image tagging web application for labelling of images.

### Usage

1. Install _Labeller_ using `pip install labeller` from the command line
2. Navigate to the directory where you wish to create your web application. This directory should contain a subdirectory named `static/images` that contains the images you wish to label
3. Run `python -m labeller class_1 class_2 ... class_n` where `class_1 class_2 ... class_n` is a list of your class names separated by spaces
4. Run `python -m flask run` to start the web application

Example:

```bash
$ python -m labeller car tree bike house
$ python -m flask run
```
See the Options section below for configuration options.

Run `python -m labeller -h` for quick help.

### How Labeller Works
When you create a new labelling application, _Labeller_ will generate a web application based on the number of classes you have defined during initialisation. Images stored in `static/images` will be displayed randomly to the user, and they can be labelled with one of the classes provided during the app initialisation.

The built application will have the following structure:

```
project_folder
├── app.py
├── db
│   └── labels.db
├── static
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── images
│   │   ├── im_1.jpg
│   │   ├── im_2.jpg
│   │   ├── ...
│   │   └── im_n.jpg
│   └── styles
│       └── dashboard.css
└── templates
    ├── about.html
    ├── footer.html
    ├── index.html
    ├── labels.html
    └── navbar.html
```

The `labels.db` file is an SQLite database containing the labels for the images that have been labelled so far. To export them to CSV format, run the following:

```
$ sqlite3 -header -csv labels.db "select * from labels;" > labels.csv
```

## FAQ

- I want to clear the database and start labelling again
  - Delete the sqlite database in the `db` directory. The app will regenerate a new, empty database when run if no database exists.
- How can I export the data from the database as a CSV file?
  - Try something like: `sqlite3 -header -csv labels.db "select * from labels;" > labels.csv`

Ensure you place your images in a the directory path `static/images`, so that a path to an image would be `./static/images/im_1.png` for example. In other words your directory structure should look as follows before you build your application:

```
project_folder
└── static
    └── images
        ├── im_1.jpg
        ├── im_2.jpg
        ├── im_3.jpg
        ├── ...
        └── im_n.jpg
```

## Options

Currently, the only user definable parameters is the list of class names. This will change as the application develops.

### Flask Options
_Labeller_ uses Flask as its web development framework. You can pass arguments to Flask as normal when invoking `python -m flask run`, or through environment variables. For example development mode can be enabled by setting an environment variable, e.g: `export FLASK_ENV=development` in Linux (in Windows use `set FLASK_ENV=development` or `$env:FLASK_ENV = "development"` in Powershell).

Some common options that can be passed with `python -m flask run` are:

- To serve the application over the network pass `--host=0.0.0.0`, so `python -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0`
- To use a different port other than the default of 5000, e.g. port 5001, pass `--port 5001`, so `python -m flask run --port 5001`

## Requirements

- Python >=3.5

The following Python packages are required, and will be downloaded automatically by `pip` during installation:

- `flask`
- `flask-bootstrap`

as well and their requirements.

## Known Issues

- HTML formatting of generated output needs work
- Images that are particularly large may have issues rendering and this will be fixed in the next update

## Future Work

- Text snippet labelling
- Consensus labelling (combining labelling efforts across users)
- Multi class labelling (labelling an image with more than one label)
- Free-text tagging/labelling
- Allow an option to resize all images in the `images` directory to a certain size when creating the web app
- API access for running instances to get image tags
- Provide option to not use CDNs for JQuery and Bootstrap
- Docker image?
