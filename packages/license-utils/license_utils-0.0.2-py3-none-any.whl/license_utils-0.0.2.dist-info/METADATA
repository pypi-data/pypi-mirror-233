# License-Utils (WIP)

This project provides utility functions around open source licenses, specifically regarding spdx.

Amongst others, it includes
- A license matcher (text --> spdx id), which is functionally equivalent to the [official spdx one](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-license-matcher), but provides a different interface and is easier (read: faster and no external installs) to use.
- Access to all licenses and corresponding metadata provided through the spdx api.


⚠️ The library is still work in progress. Use it at your own risk and expect breaking changes in the future.

### Credits

The this project/repo is lagely based on the [license matcher by spdx](https://github.com/spdx/spdx-license-matcher)
