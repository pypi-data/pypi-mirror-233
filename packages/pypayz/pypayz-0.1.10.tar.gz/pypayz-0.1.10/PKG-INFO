## Getting Started
This section provides instructions on how to get started with the PAYZ SDK.

### Installation
```bash
pip install pypayz
```

## Features
 This section describes the main features and capabilities of the PAYZ SDK.

### Feature 1: Create payment widget

```python
from pypayz import Widget

widget = Widget(1, 'secret_key')

payment_url = await widget.create_payment(
    Widget.PaymentModel(
        product='client@mail.ru',
        price='Xiaomi 9T',
        quantity=1000,
        message=1,
        description='Hello thanks for order',
        currency='Xiaomi 9T',
        fiat_currency='USDT',
        language='rub',
        uuid='ru'
    )
)  # Returns payment url
```


### Feature 2: Verify payment

```python
from pypayz import Webhook

payment_data = {}  # Replace with actual POST data
payment = Webhook(payment_data)

if payment.is_verified('secret_key') and payment.is_success():
    # Payment success logic
    # For example:
    client = payment.get_client()  # Get client email
    # Update user balance:
    # User.objects.filter(email=client).update(balance=payment.get_amount())
```

### Feature 3: Payouts

```python
from pypayz import Payout

payout = Payout(merchant_id, secret_key)

await payout.crypto_pay(
    Payout.CryptoPayModel(
        address=address,
        amount=amount,
        currency=currency,
    )
)
```
