The KF model (OKF object) can be adjusted to any new filtering problem via its arguments.
This module provides an example for such arguments, corresponding to a simplified 2D lidar problem.

Note:
    - model_args() returns the arguments for the constructor OKF().
    - F is of size (dim_x, dim_x) = (4, 4).
    - H is of size (dim_z, dim_x) = (2, 4).
    - Trajectory initialization:
        Either init_z2x or x0 need to be defined.
        If x0 is defined, then every trajectory is initialized to the initial guess x=x0.
        Otherwise, the state is initialized to x=init_z2x(z) - only after an observation is received.
        In this example, we prefer the latter: we derive the initialization from the first observation.

Specifically, for the simplified 2D lidar problem:
    - The system state is its location and velocity (x,y,vx,vy).
    - The dynamics model is a constant-velocity motion.
    - The observation model is a single sensor with known location that observes the location (x,y).
    - The goal is to predict either the state (x,y,vx,vy) or the location (x,y).
