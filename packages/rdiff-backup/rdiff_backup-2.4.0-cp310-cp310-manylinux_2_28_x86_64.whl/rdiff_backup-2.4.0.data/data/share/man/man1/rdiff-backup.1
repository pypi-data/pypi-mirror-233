.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
rdiff\-backup is a script, written in \fBpython\fP(1) that backs up one directory to another.
The target directory ends up a copy (mirror) of the source directory, but extra reverse diffs are stored in a special sub\-directory of that target directory, so you can still recover files lost some time ago.
The idea is to combine the best features of a mirror and an incremental backup.
rdiff\-backup also preserves symlinks, special files, hardlinks, permissions, uid/gid ownership, and modification times.
.sp
rdiff\-backup can also operate in a bandwidth efficient manner over a pipe, like \fBrsync\fP(1).
Thus you can use ssh and rdiff\-backup to securely back a hard drive up to a remote location, and only the differences will be transmitted.
Using the default settings, rdiff\-backup requires that the remote system accept ssh connections, and that rdiff\-backup is installed in the user\(cqs PATH on the remote system.
See the REMOTE OPERATION section for details.
.sp
Note that you should not write to the mirror directory except with rdiff\-backup.
Many of the increments are stored as reverse diffs, so if you delete or modify a file, you may lose the ability to restore previous versions of that file.
.sp
Finally, this man page is intended more as a precise description of the behavior and syntax of rdiff\-backup.
New users may want to check out the \fBexamples\fP file included in the rdiff\-backup distribution.

\-\-chars\-to\-quote, \-\-override\-chars\-to\-quote \fIchars\fP
.RS 4
If the filesystem to which we are backing up is not case\-sensitive, automatic "quoting" of characters occurs.
For example, a file \*(Aq\f(CRDeveloper.doc\fP\*(Aq will be converted into \*(Aq\f(CR;068eveloper.doc\fP\*(Aq.
To quote other characters or force quoting, e.g.
in case rdiff\-backup doesn\(cqt recognize a case\-insensitive file system, you need to specify this option.
\fIchars\fP is a string of characters fit to be used in regexp square brackets (e.g.
\*(Aq\f(CRA\-Z\fP\*(Aq as in \*(Aq\f(CR[A\-Z]\fP\*(Aq).

\-\-null\-separator
.RS 4
Use nulls (\f(CR\(rs0\fP) instead of newlines (\f(CR\(rsn\fP) as line separators, which may help when dealing with filenames containing newlines.
This affects the expected format of the files specified by the \fB\-\-{include|exclude}\-filelist[\-stdin]\fP switches as well as the format of the files statistics.
.RE

\-\-parsable\-output
.RS 4
If set, rdiff\-backup\(cqs output will be tailored for easy parsing by computers, instead of convenience for humans.
Currently this only applies when listing increments using the \fBlist increments\fP action, where the time will be given in seconds since the epoch.
.RE

.RS 4
Specify an alternate method of connecting to a remote computer.
This is necessary to get rdiff\-backup not to use ssh for remote backups, or if, for instance, rdiff\-backup is not in the PATH on the remote side.
See the REMOTE OPERATION section for details.

Sets the directory that rdiff\-backup uses for temporary files to the given path.
The environment variables TMPDIR, TEMP, and TMP can also be used to set the temporary files directory.
See the documentation of the Python tempfile module for more information.
If set explicitly, remember that "no space left" error messages \fImight\fP apply to this directory.

\-\-use\-compatible\-timestamps
.RS 4
Create timestamps in which the hour/minute/second separator is a \- (hyphen) instead of a : (colon).
It is safe to use this option on one backup, and then not use it on another;
rdiff\-backup supports the intermingling of different timestamp formats.
This option is enabled by default on platforms which require that the colon be escaped.

Compare a directory with the backup set at the given time.
This can be useful to see how archived data differs from current data, or to check that a backup is current.
.sp
\-\-method \fImethod\fP
.RS 4
method used to compare can be either \fBmeta\fP, \fBfull\fP or \fBhash\fP, where the default is \fBmeta\fP, which is also how rdiff\-backup decides which file needs to be backed\-up.
Note that with \fBfull\fP, the repository data will be copied in its entirety to the source side and compared byte by byte.
This is the slowest but most complete compare method.
With \fBhash\fP only the SHA1 checksum of regular files will be compared.
With \fBmeta\fP only the metadata of files will be compared (name, size, date, type, etc).
.RE
.sp

.RS 4
List the files that have changed in the destination directory
since the given time. See TIME FORMATS for the format of time.
If a directory in the archive is specified, list only the files
under that directory. This option does not read the source
directory; it is used to compare the contents of two different
rdiff\-backup sessions.
See TIME FORMATS for details.
.RE

.RS 4
Show or not the size of each increment in the repository. The default
is to \fInot\fP show sizes. When showing sizes, it becomes allowable to
specify a directory within a repository, then only the cumulated
sizes of that directory will be shown.
.RE

.sp
regress [COMPRESSION OPTIONS] [USER GROUP OPTIONS] [TIMESTAMP OPTIONS] \fIrepository\fP
.RS 4
If an rdiff\-backup session fails, this action will undo the failed directory.
This happens automatically if you attempt to back\-up to a directory and the last backup failed.
You can use the \fB\-\-force\fP option to undo the last backup even if it wasn\(cqt failed (starting with API 201, use \fB\-\-api\-version\fP if necessary).
.RE
.sp
remove \fBincrements\fP \fB\-\-older\-than\fP \fItime\fP [\fB\-\-size\fP] \fIrepository\fP
.RS 4
Remove the incremental backup information in the destination directory that has been around longer than the given time, or the oldest one if no time is provided.
.sp
By default, rdiff\-backup will only delete information from one session at a time.
To remove two or more sessions at the same time, supply the \fB\-\-force\fP option (rdiff\-backup will tell you if it is required).
.sp
Note that snapshots of deleted files are covered by this operation.
Thus if you deleted a file two weeks ago, backed up immediately afterwards, and then ran rdiff\-backup with \*(Aq\f(CRremove increments \-\-older\-than 10D\fP\*(Aq today, no trace of that file would remain.
.sp
\-\-older\-than \fItime\fP

\-\-compare\-inode, \-\-no\-compare\-inode
.RS 4
This option prevents rdiff\-backup from flagging a hardlinked file as changed when its device number and/or inode changes.
This option is useful in situations where the source filesystem lacks persistent device and/or inode numbering.
For example, network filesystems may have mount\-to\-mount differences in their device number (but possibly stable inode numbers);
USB/1394 devices may come up at different device numbers each remount (but would generally have same inode number);
and there are filesystems which don\(cqt even have the same inode numbers from use to use.
Without the option rdiff\-backup may generate unnecessary numbers of tiny diff files.

There are two ways to tell rdiff\-backup to restore a file or directory:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 1." 4.2
.\}
you can run rdiff\-backup \fBrestore\fP on a mirror file and define a time from which to restore (by default the latest one).
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 2." 4.2
.\}
you can run the \fBrestore\fP action on an increment file with the sub\-option \fB\-\-increment\fP.
.RE
.sp
For example, suppose in the past you have run:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
rdiff\-backup backup /usr /usr.backup
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
to back up the \*(Aq\f(CR/usr\fP\*(Aq directory into the \*(Aq\f(CR/usr.backup\fP\*(Aq directory, and now want a copy of the \*(Aq\f(CR/usr/local\fP\*(Aq directory the way it was 3 days ago placed at \*(Aq\f(CR/usr/local.old\fP\*(Aq.
.sp
One way to do this is to run:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
rdiff\-backup restore \-\-at 3D /usr.backup/local /usr/local.old
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
here above the \*(Aq\f(CR3D\fP\*(Aq means 3 days (for other ways to specify the time, see the TIME FORMATS section).
The \*(Aq\f(CR/usr.backup/local\fP\*(Aq directory was selected, because that is the directory containing the current version of \*(Aq\f(CRusr/local\fP\*(Aq.
.sp
Note that the parameter of \fB\-\-at\fP always specifies an exact time.
(So \*(Aq\f(CR3D\fP\*(Aq refers to the moment 72 hours before the present).
If there was no backup made at that time, rdiff\-backup restores the state recorded for the previous backup.
For instance, in the above case, if \*(Aq\f(CR3D\fP\*(Aq is used, and there are only backups from 2 days and 4 days ago, \*(Aq\f(CR/usr/local\fP\*(Aq as it was 4 days ago will be restored.
.sp
The second way to restore files involves finding the corresponding increment file.
It would be in the \*(Aq\f(CR/backup/rdiff\-backup\-data/increments/usr\fP\*(Aq directory, and its name would be something like \*(Aq\f(CRlocal.2002\-11\-09T12:43:53\-04:00.dir\fP\*(Aq where the time indicates it is from 3 days ago.
Note that the increment files all end in \*(Aq\f(CR.diff\fP\*(Aq, \*(Aq\f(CR.snapshot\fP\*(Aq, \*(Aq\f(CR.dir\fP\*(Aq, or \*(Aq\f(CR.missing\fP\*(Aq, where \*(Aq\f(CR.missing\fP\*(Aq just means that the file didn\(cqt exist at that time (finally, some of these may be gzip\-compressed, and have an extra \*(Aq\f(CR.gz\fP\*(Aq to indicate this).
Then running:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
rdiff\-backup restore \-\-increment \(rs
    /backup/rdiff\-backup\-data/increments/usr/local.{time}.dir \(rs
    /usr/local.old
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
would also restore the file as desired.
.sp
If you are not sure exactly which version of a file you need, it is probably easiest to either restore from the increments files as described immediately above, or to see which increments are available with \*(Aq\f(CRlist increments\fP\*(Aq, and then specify an exact time with \fB\-\-at\fP.
.SH "TIME FORMATS"
.sp
rdiff\-backup uses time strings in two places.
.sp
Firstly, all of the increment files rdiff\-backup creates will have the time in their filenames in the w3 datetime format as described in a w3 note at \c
.URL "https://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE\-datetime" "" "."
Basically they look like \*(Aq\f(CR2001\-07\-15T04:09:38\-07:00\fP\*(Aq, which is basically "{Year}\-{Month}\-{Day}T{Hours}:{Minutes}:{Seconds}{Timezone}", the time zone being 7 hours \fIbehind\fP UTC in this example (hence the minus).
.sp
Secondly, the \fB\-\-at\fP, \fB\-\-changed\-since\fP, \fB\-\-older\-than\fP options take a time string, which can be given in any of several formats:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 1." 4.2
.\}
the string \*(Aq\f(CRnow\fP\*(Aq (refers to the current time)
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 2." 4.2
.\}
a sequences of digits, like \*(Aq\f(CR123456890\fP\*(Aq (indicating the time in seconds after the epoch)
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 3.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 3." 4.2
.\}
A string like \*(Aq\f(CR2002\-01\-25T07:00:00+02:00\fP\*(Aq in datetime format
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 4.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 4." 4.2
.\}
An interval, which is a number followed by one of the characters s, m, h, D, W, M, or Y (indicating seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or years respectively), or a series of such pairs.
In this case the string refers to the time that preceded the current time by the length of the interval.
For instance, \*(Aq\f(CR1h78m"\fP\*(Aq indicates the time that was one hour and 78 minutes ago.
The calendar here is unsophisticated: a month is always 30 days, a year is always 365 days, and a day is always 86400 seconds.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 5.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 5." 4.2
.\}
A date format of the form "YYYY/MM/DD", "YYYY\-MM\-DD", "MM/DD/YYYY", or "MM\-DD\-YYYY", which indicates midnight on the day in question, relative to the current timezone settings.
For instance, \*(Aq\f(CR2002/3/5\fP\*(Aq, \*(Aq\f(CR03\-05\-2002\fP\*(Aq, and \*(Aq\f(CR2002\-3\-05\fP\*(Aq all mean March 5th, 2002 (needless to say that starting with the year is less confusing for non\-Americans).
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 6.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 6." 4.2
.\}
A backup session specification which is a non\-negative integer followed by \*(Aq\f(CRB\fP\*(Aq.
For instance, \*(Aq\f(CR0B\fP\*(Aq specifies the time of the current mirror, and \*(Aq\f(CR3B\fP\*(Aq specifies the time of the 3rd newest increment.
.RE
.SH "REMOTE OPERATION"
.sp
In order to access remote files, rdiff\-backup opens up a pipe to a copy of rdiff\-backup running on the remote machine.
Thus rdiff\-backup must be installed on both ends.
To open this pipe, rdiff\-backup first splits the location into \*(Aq\f(CRhost_info::pathname\fP\*(Aq.
It then substitutes \*(Aq\f(CRhost_info\fP\*(Aq into the remote schema, and runs the resulting command, reading its input and output.
.sp
The \*(Aq\f(CRhost_info\fP\*(Aq can be anything understood as a destination by your version of SSH.
Assuming it is the standard OpenSSH, it can be:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
either \*(Aq\f(CR[user@]hostname\fP\*(Aq
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
or a URI of the form \*(Aq\f(CRssh://[user@]hostname[:port]\fP\*(Aq.
.RE
.sp
The default remote schema is \*(Aq\f(CRssh \-C {h} rdiff\-backup \-\-server\fP\*(Aq where \*(Aq\f(CRhost_info\fP\*(Aq is substituted for \*(Aq\f(CR{h}\fP\*(Aq.
So if the \*(Aq\f(CRhost_info\fP\*(Aq is \*(Aq\f(CRuser@host.net\fP\*(Aq, then rdiff\-backup runs \*(Aq\f(CRssh \c
.MTO "user\(athost.net" "" ""
rdiff\-backup \-\-server\fP\*(Aq.
Using \fB\-\-remote\-schema\fP, rdiff\-backup can invoke an arbitrary command in order to open up a remote pipe.
For instance,
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
rdiff\-backup \-\-remote\-schema \*(Aqcd /usr; {h}\*(Aq backup \(rs
                    foo \*(Aqrdiff\-backup server\*(Aq::bar
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
is basically equivalent to (but slower than)
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
rdiff\-backup backup foo /usr/bar
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
Concerning quoting, if for some reason you need to put two consecutive colons in the \*(Aq\f(CRhost_info\fP\*(Aq section of a \*(Aq\f(CRhost_info::pathname\fP\*(Aq argument, or in the pathname of a local file, you can quote one of them by prepending a backslash.
So in \*(Aq\f(CRa\(rs::b::c\fP\*(Aq, \*(Aq\f(CRhost_info\fP\*(Aq is \*(Aq\f(CRa::b\fP\*(Aq and the pathname is \*(Aq\f(CRc\fP\*(Aq.
Similarly, if you want to refer to a local file whose filename contains two consecutive colons, like \*(Aq\f(CRstrange::file\fP\*(Aq, you\(cqll have to quote one of the colons as in \*(Aq\f(CRstrange\(rs::file\fP\*(Aq.
Because the backslash is a quote character in these circumstances, it too must be quoted to get a literal backslash, so \*(Aq\f(CRfoo\(rs::\(rs\(rsbar\fP\*(Aq evaluates to \*(Aq\f(CRfoo::\(rsbar\fP\*(Aq.
To make things more complicated, because the backslash is also a common shell quoting character, you may need to type in \*(Aq\f(CR\(rs\(rs\(rs\(rs\fP\*(Aq at the shell prompt to get a literal backslash.
.sp
You may also use the placehoders \*(Aq\f(CR{Vx}\fP\*(Aq, \*(Aq\f(CR{Vy}\fP\*(Aq and \*(Aq\f(CR{Vz}\fP\*(Aq for the \*(Aq\f(CRx.y.z\fP\*(Aq version of rdiff\-backup, so that you can have multiple versions of rdiff\-backup installed on the server, and automatically targeted from the client.
.sp
For example, if you have rdiff\-backup 2.1.5 and 2.2.1 installed in virtual environments on the server, respectively under \*(Aq\f(CR/usr/local/lib/rdiff\-backup\-2.0\fP\*(Aq and \*(Aq\f(CR/usr/local/lib/rdiff\-backup\-2.1\fP\*(Aq (we assume that the z\-Version isn\(cqt relevant to any kind of compatibility), then the client may be called with the following remote schema:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
ssh \-C {h} /usr/local/lib/rdiff\-backup\-{Vx}.{Vy} \-\-server
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
The client will then use the correct version of rdiff\-backup based on its own version \*(Aq\f(CRx.y.z\fP\*(Aq.
You\(cqll find more explanations in the \fBmigration\fP file in the documentation.
.sp
If you need to include a literal \*(Aq\f(CR%\fP\*(Aq in the string specified by \fB\-\-remote\-schema\fP, quote it with another \*(Aq\f(CR%\fP\*(Aq, as in \*(Aq\f(CR%%\fP\*(Aq (this is due to the compatibility with the deprecated host placeholder \*(Aq\f(CR%s\fP\*(Aq, which you shouldn\(cqt use anymore).
.sp
And finally, if you need to include literal \*(Aq\f(CR{ }\fP\*(Aq (curly braces) in the the string specified by \fB\-\-remote\-schema\fP, quote them (both) by doubling each of them up, as in \*(Aq\f(CR{{ foo=0; }}\fP\*(Aq.
.sp
Although ssh itself may be secure, using rdiff\-backup in the default way presents some security risks.
For instance if the server is run as root, then an attacker who compromised the client could then use rdiff\-backup to overwrite arbitrary server files by "backing up" over them.
Such a setup can be made more secure by using the sshd configuration option \*(Aq\f(CRcommand="rdiff\-backup server"\fP\*(Aq possibly along with the \fB\-\-restrict\-path\fP and \fB\-\-restrict\-mode\fP options to rdiff\-backup.
For more information, see the web page, the wiki, and the entries for those options on this man page.
.SH "FILE SELECTION"
.sp
rdiff\-backup has a number of file selection options.
When rdiff\-backup is run, it searches through the given source directory and backs up all the files matching the specified options.
This selection system may appear complicated, but it is supposed to be flexible and easy\-to\-use.
If you just want to learn the basics, first look at the selection examples in the \fBexamples\fP file included in the package, or on the web at \c
.URL "https://rdiff\-backup.net/examples.html" "" "."
.sp
rdiff\-backup\(cqs selection system was originally inspired by \fBrsync\fP(1), but there are many differences.
For instance, trailing backslashes have no special significance.
.if n .sp
.RS 4
.it 1 an-trap
.nr an-no-space-flag 1
.nr an-break-flag 1
.br
.ps +1
.B Important
.ps -1
.br
.sp
include and exclude patterns under Windows solely support slashes \*(Aq\f(CR/\fP\*(Aq as file separators, given that backslashes \*(Aq\f(CR\(rs\fP\*(Aq have a special meaning in regex/glob patterns.
.sp .5v
.RE
.sp
All the available file selection conditions are listed under SELECTION OPTIONS.
.sp
Two principles need to be understood before really starting:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 1." 4.2
.\}
pattern matching is stupid about paths, it just does pattern matching and can\(cqt interpret patterns like path, especially it can\(cqt resolve absolute into relative paths and vice\-versa (compare with the \*(Aq\f(CR\-path\fP\*(Aq option of find).
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 2." 4.2
.\}
pattern matching is done on the complete path of each found file (no partial matching and no file name matching).
Beware that complete path does \fInot\fP mean full path, it can be a complete relative path.
.RE
.sp
For example, the pattern \*(Aq\f(CRbar\fP\*(Aq matches the path \*(Aq\f(CRbar\fP\*(Aq, but doesn\(cqt match the path \*(Aq\f(CRfoo/bar\fP\*(Aq and neither the path \*(Aq\f(CR./bar\fP\*(Aq.
Both are matched by the pattern \*(Aq\f(CR*/bar\fP\*(Aq, as well as by \*(Aq\f(CR**/bar\fP\*(Aq.
This last pattern would match any path containing the file \*(Aq\f(CRbar\fP\*(Aq, e.g.
\*(Aq\f(CRfoo/boz/bar\fP\*(Aq.
.sp
Each file selection condition either matches or doesn\(cqt match a given file.
A given file is excluded by the file selection system exactly when the first matching file selection condition specifies that the file be excluded;
otherwise the file is included.
When backing up, if a file is excluded, rdiff\-backup acts as if that file does not exist in the source directory.
When restoring, an excluded file is considered not to exist in either the source or target directories.
.sp
For instance,
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
rdiff\-backup backup \-\-include /usr \(rs
                    \-\-exclude /usr /usr /backup
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
is exactly the same as
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
rdiff\-backup backup /usr /backup
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
because the include and exclude directives match exactly the same files, and the \fB\-\-include\fP comes first, giving it precedence.
Similarly,
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
rdiff\-backup backup \-\-include /usr/local/bin \(rs
                    \-\-exclude /usr/local /usr /backup
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
would backup the \*(Aq\f(CR/usr/local/bin\fP\*(Aq directory (and its contents), but not \*(Aq\f(CR/usr/local/doc\fP\*(Aq.
.sp
The include, exclude, include\-globbing\-filelist, and exclude\-globbing\-filelist options accept extended shell globbing patterns.
These patterns can contain the special patterns \*(Aq\f(CR*\fP\*(Aq, \*(Aq\f(CR**\fP\*(Aq, \*(Aq\f(CR?\fP\*(Aq, and \*(Aq\f(CR[...]\fP\*(Aq.
As in a normal shell, \*(Aq\f(CR*\fP\*(Aq can be expanded to any string of characters not containing \*(Aq\f(CR/\fP\*(Aq, \*(Aq\f(CR?\fP\*(Aq expands to any character except \*(Aq\f(CR/\fP\*(Aq, and \*(Aq\f(CR[...]\fP\*(Aq expands to a single character of those characters specified (ranges are acceptable).
The new special pattern, \*(Aq\f(CR**\fP\*(Aq, expands to any string of characters whether or not it contains \*(Aq\f(CR/\fP\*(Aq.
Furthermore, if the pattern starts with \*(Aq\f(CRignorecase:\fP\*(Aq (case insensitive), then this prefix will be removed and any character in the string can be replaced with an upper or lowercase version of itself.
.sp
If you need to match filenames which contain the above globbing characters, they may be escaped using a backslash \*(Aq\f(CR\(rs\fP\*(Aq.
The backslash will only escape the character following it so for \*(Aq\f(CR**\fP\*(Aq you will need to use \*(Aq\f(CR\(rs*\(rs*\fP\*(Aq to avoid escaping it to the \*(Aq\f(CR*\fP\*(Aq globbing character.
.sp
Remember that you may need to quote these characters when typing them into a shell, so the shell does not interpret the globbing patterns before rdiff\-backup sees them.
.sp
The \fB\-\-exclude\fP \fIpattern\fP option matches a file if and only if:

.sp
For example,
.sp
.if n .RS 4

.if n .RE
.sp
And similarly:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
\-\-include /usr/local

specifies that \*(Aq\f(CR/usr\fP\*(Aq, \*(Aq\f(CR/usr/local\fP\*(Aq, \*(Aq\f(CR/usr/local/lib\fP\*(Aq, and \*(Aq\f(CR/usr/local/lib/netscape\fP\*(Aq (but not \*(Aq\f(CR/usr/doc\fP\*(Aq) all be backed up.
Thus you don\(cqt have to worry about including parent directories to make sure that included subdirectories have somewhere to go.
Finally,
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
\-\-include ignorecase:\*(Aq/usr/[a\-z0\-9]foo/*/**.py\*(Aq
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
would match a file like \*(Aq\f(CR/usr/5fOO/hello/there/world.py\fP\*(Aq.
If it did match anything, it would also match \*(Aq\f(CR/usr\fP\*(Aq.
If there is no existing file that the given pattern can be expanded into, the option will not match \*(Aq\f(CR/usr\fP\*(Aq.
.sp
The \fB\-\-include\-filelist\fP, \fB\-\-exclude\-filelist\fP, \fB\-\-include\-filelist\-stdin\fP, and \fB\-\-exclude\-filelist\-stdin\fP options also introduce file selection conditions.
They direct rdiff\-backup to read in a file, each line of which is a file specification, and to include or exclude the matching files.
Lines are separated by newlines or nulls, depending on whether the \fB\-\-null\-separator\fP switch was given.
Each line in a filelist is interpreted similarly to the way extended shell patterns are, with a few exceptions:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 1." 4.2
.\}
Globbing patterns like \*(Aq\f(CR*\fP\*(Aq, \*(Aq\f(CR**\fP\*(Aq, \*(Aq\f(CR?\fP\*(Aq, and \*(Aq\f(CR[...]\fP\*(Aq are not expanded.
.RE

.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 2." 4.2

Include patterns do not match files in a directory that is included.
So \*(Aq\f(CR/usr/local\fP\*(Aq in an include file will not match \*(Aq\f(CR/usr/local/doc\fP\*(Aq.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 3.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 3." 4.2
.\}
Lines starting with \*(Aq\f(CR+ [...]\fP\*(Aq (plus followed by a space) are interpreted as include directives, even if found in a filelist referenced by \fB\-\-exclude\-filelist\fP.
Similarly, lines starting with \*(Aq\f(CR\- [...]\fP\*(Aq (minus followed by a space) exclude files even if they are found within an include filelist.
.RE
.sp
For example, if the file \*(Aq\f(CRlist.txt\fP\*(Aq contains the lines:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
/usr/local
\- /usr/local/doc
/usr/local/bin

\- /var
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
then \*(Aq\f(CR\-\-include\-filelist list.txt\fP\*(Aq would include \*(Aq\f(CR/usr\fP\*(Aq, \*(Aq\f(CR/usr/local\fP\*(Aq, and \*(Aq\f(CR/usr/local/bin\fP\*(Aq.
It would exclude \*(Aq\f(CR/usr/local/doc\fP\*(Aq, \*(Aq\f(CR/usr/local/doc/python\fP\*(Aq, etc.
It neither excludes nor includes \*(Aq\f(CR/usr/local/man\fP\*(Aq, leaving the fate of this directory to the next specification condition.
Finally, it is undefined what happens with \f(CR\*(Aq/var\fP\*(Aq.
A single file list should not contain conflicting file specifications.
.sp
The \fB\-\-include\-globbing\-filelist\fP and \fB\-\-exclude\-globbing\-filelist\fP options also specify filelists, but each line in the filelist will be interpreted as a globbing pattern the way \fB\-\-include\fP and \fB\-\-exclude\fP options are interpreted (although \*(Aq\f(CR+ \fP\*(Aq and \*(Aq\f(CR\- \fP\*(Aq prefixing is still allowed).
For instance, if the file \*(Aq\f(CRglobbing\-list.txt\fP\*(Aq contains the lines:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
dir/foo
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
Then \*(Aq\f(CR\-\-include\-globbing\-filelist globbing\-list.txt\fP\*(Aq would be exactly the same as specifying on the command line:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
\-\-include dir/foo \-\-include dir/bar \-\-exclude **
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
Finally, the \fB\-\-include\-regexp\fP and \fB\-\-exclude\-regexp\fP allow files to be included and excluded if their filenames match a python regular expression.
Regular expression syntax is too complicated to explain here, but is covered in Python\(cqs library reference.
Unlike the \fB\-\-include\fP and \fB\-\-exclude\fP options, the regular expression options don\(cqt match files containing or contained in matched files.
So for instance
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
\-\-include \*(Aq[0\-9]{7}(?!foo)\*(Aq
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE

.SH "USERS AND GROUPS"
.sp
There can be complications preserving ownership across systems.
For instance the username that owns a file on the source system may not exist on the destination.
Here is how rdiff\-backup maps ownership on the source to the destination (or vice\-versa, in the case of restoring):
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 1." 4.2
.\}
If the \fB\-\-preserve\-numerical\-ids\fP option is given, the remote files will always have the same uid and gid, both for ownership and ACL entries.
This may cause unames and gnames to change.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 2." 4.2
.\}
Otherwise, attempt to preserve the user and group names for ownership and in ACLs.
This may result in files having different uids and gids across systems.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 3.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 3." 4.2
.\}
If a name cannot be preserved (e.g.
because the username does not exist), preserve the original id, but only in cases of user and group ownership.
For ACLs, omit any entry that has a bad user or group name.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 4.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 4." 4.2
.\}
The \fB\-\-user\-mapping\-file\fP and \fB\-\-group\-mapping\-file\fP options override this behavior.
If either of these options is given, the policy described in 2 and 3 above will be followed, but with the mapped user and group instead of the original.
If you specify both \fB\-\-preserve\-numerical\-ids\fP and one of the mapping options, the behavior is undefined.
.RE
.sp
The user and group mapping files both have the same format:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
old_name_or_id1:new_name_or_id1
old_name_or_id2:new_name_or_id2
[...etc...]
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
Each line should contain a name or id, followed by a colon \*(Aq\f(CR:\fP\*(Aq, followed by another name or id.
If a name or id is not listed, they are treated in the default way described above.
.sp
When restoring, the above behavior is also followed, but note that the original source user/group information will be the input, not the already mapped user/group information present in the backup repository.
For instance, suppose you have mapped all the files owned by alice in the source so that they are owned by ben in the repository, and now you want to restore, making sure the files owned originally by alice are still owned by alice.
In this case there is no need to use any of the mapping options.
However, if you wanted to restore the files so that the files originally owned by alice on the source are now owned by ben, you would have to use the mapping options, even though you just want the unames of the repository\(cqs files preserved in the restored files.
.sp

.SH "FILES"

\fIany\-config\-file\fP
.RS 4
you can create a file with one option/action/sub\-option per line and use it on the command line with an at sign prefix like \fI@any\-config\-file\fP and its content will be interpreted as if given on the command line.
.sp
For example, creating a file \*(Aq\f(CRmybackup\fP\*(Aq with following content:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
.fam C
\-\-verbosity
5
backup
source_dir
target_dir
.fam
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
and calling \*(Aq\f(CRrdiff\-backup @mybackup\fP\*(Aq will be the same as calling \*(Aq\f(CRrdiff\-backup \-\-verbosity 5 backup source_dir target_dir\fP\*(Aq.
.RE
.sp
\fBsession_statistics\fP, \fBfile_statistics\fP
.RS 4
Every session rdiff\-backup saves various statistics into two files, the session statistics file at \*(Aq\f(CRrdiff\-backup\-data/session_statistics.{datetime}.data\fP\*(Aq and the files statistics at \*(Aq\f(CRrdiff\-backup\-data/directory_statistics.{datetime}.data\fP\*(Aq.
They are both text files and contain similar information: how many files changed, how many were deleted, the total size of increment files created, etc.
However, the session statistics file is intended to be very readable and only describes the session as a whole.
The files statistics file is more compact (and slightly less readable) but describes every directory backed up.
It also may be compressed to save space.
.sp

.RE
.sp
\fBbackup.log\fP, \fBrestore.log\fP, \fBerror_log\fP
.RS 4
rdiff\-backup will save various messages to the log file, which is \*(Aq\f(CRrdiff\-backup\-data/backup.log\fP\*(Aq for backup sessions and \*(Aq\f(CRrdiff\-backup\-data/restore.log\fP\*(Aq for restore sessions.
Generally what is written to this file will coincide with the messages displayed to stdout or stderr, although this can be changed with the \fB\-\-terminal\-verbosity\fP option.
.sp
Errors during backup are also written to a file \*(Aq\f(CRrdiff\-backup\-data/error_log.{datetime}.data\fP\*(Aq.
.sp
The log files are not compressed and can become quite large if rdiff\-backup is run with high verbosity.
