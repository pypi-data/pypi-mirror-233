.SH "SYNOPSIS"

\fBrdiff\-backup\-statistics\fP [\fB\-\-begin\-time\fP \fItime\fP] [\fB\-\-end\-time\fP \fItime\fP] [\fB\-\-minimum\-ratio\fP \fIratio\fP] [\fB\-\-null\-separator\fP] [\fB\-\-quiet\fP] [\fB\-h\fP|\fB\-\-help\fP] [\fB\-V\fP|\fB\-\-version\fP] \fIrepository\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBrdiff\-backup\-statistics\fP
reads the matching statistics files in a backup repository made by
\fBrdiff\-backup\fP
and prints some summary statistics to the screen.  It does not alter
the repository in any way.
.sp
The required argument is the pathname of the root of an rdiff\-backup
repository.  For instance, if you ran \(aq\f(CRrdiff\-backup in out\fP\(aq,
you could later run \(aq\f(CRrdiff\-backup\-statistics out\fP\(aq.
.sp
The output has two parts.  The first is simply an average of the all
matching session_statistics files.  The meaning of these fields is
explained in the FAQ included in the package, and also at
.URL "https://rdiff\-backup.net/FAQ.html#what_do_the_various_fields_mean_in_the_session_statistics_and_directory_statistics_files" "" " "
.
.sp
The second section lists some particularly significant files
(including directories).  These files are either contain a lot of
data, take up increment space, or contain a lot of changed files.  All
the files that are above the minimum ratio (default 5%) will be
listed.
.sp
If a file or directory is listed, its contributions are subtracted
from its parent.  That is why the percentage listed after a directory
can be larger than the percentage of its parent.  Without this, the
root directory would always be the largest, and the output would be
boring.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\-\-begin\-time \fItime\fP
.RS 4
Do not read statistics files older than \fItime\fP.
By default, all statistics files will be read.
\fItime\fP should be in the same format taken by \fB\-\-restore\-as\-of\fP.  (See
\fBTIME FORMATS\fP in the rdiff\-backup man page for details.)
.RE
.sp
\-\-end\-time \fItime\fP
.RS 4
Like \fB\-\-begin\-time\fP but exclude statistics files later than \fItime\fP.
.RE
.sp
\-h, \-\-help
.RS 4
Output a short usage description and exit.
.RE
.sp
\-\-minimum\-ratio \fIratio\fP
.RS 4
Print all directories contributing more than the given ratio to the
total.  The default value is .05, or 5 percent.
.RE
.sp
\-\-null\-separator
.RS 4
Specify that the lines of the file_statistics file are separated by
nulls (\(aq\(rs0\(aq).  The default is to assume that newlines separate.  Use
this switch if rdiff\-backup was run with the \fB\-\-null\-separator\fP when
making the given repository.
.RE
.sp
\-\-quiet
.RS 4
Suppress printing of the \(oq\f(CRProcessing statistics from session...\fP\(cq
output lines.
.RE
.sp
\-V, \-\-version
.RS 4
Output full path to command and version then exit.
.RE
.SH "BUGS"
.sp
When aggregating multiple statistics files, some directories above
(but close to) the minimum ratio may not be displayed.  For this
reason, you may want to set the minimum\-ratio lower than need.
