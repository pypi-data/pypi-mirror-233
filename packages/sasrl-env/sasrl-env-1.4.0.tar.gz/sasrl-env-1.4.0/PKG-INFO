# sasrl-env

## Overview
This package is used for communicating with a remote RL python environment of SAS customers. It uses the google remote procedure call (gRPC) to provide a fast communication.   

### Installation
The sasrl-env package needs to be installed using the following command:
  - pip install sasrl-env

### Starting an environment server
In the python environment, the installed package needs to be imported and started using the following lines of codes:
  - from sasrl_env import runServer
  - runServer.start(#PORT_NUMBER)

**Notes**: 
- If you do not specify a port when running the server, the environment controller will assign an available port automatically.
- If the specified port is not free, it will increment the port numbers until finding the first available port.
