# CLU - Common Loop Utils

This repository contains common functionality for writing ML training loops. The
goal is to make trainings loops short and readable (but moving common tasks to
small libraries) without removing the flexibility required for research.

To get started, check out this Colab:

https://colab.research.google.com/github/google/CommonLoopUtils/blob/main/clu_synopsis.ipynb

If you're looking for usage examples, see:

https://github.com/google/flax/tree/main/examples

You can also find answers to common questions about CLU on Flax Github
discussions page:

Note: As this point we are not accepting contributions. Please fork the
repository if you want to extend the libraries for your use case.
