BACnet Proxy is an agent that supports communication and management of BACnet devices.

Communication with a BACnet device on a network happens via a single virtual BACnet device. In the VOLTTRON driver framework,
we use a separate agent specifically for communicating with BACnet devices and managing the virtual BACnet device.

# Requires

* python >= 3.10
* volttron >= 10.0
* bacpypes == 0.16.7
