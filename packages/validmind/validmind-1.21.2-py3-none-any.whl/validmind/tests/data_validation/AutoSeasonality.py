class AutoSeasonality(Metric):
    """
    **Purpose:**
    The AutoSeasonality metric is intended to automatically detect and determine the optimal seasonal order or period
    for each variable in a time series dataset. The aim here is to quantify the inherent periodic pattern and
    seasonality that recurs after fixed intervals of time in the dataset. This is especially crucial for
    forecasting-based models, where understanding the seasonality component of the series can substantially enhance
    prediction accuracy.

    **Test Mechanism:**
    The implementation uses the seasonal decomposition method from Statsmodels Python library, broken down into
    'additive' model type for each variable within the defined range of 'min_period' and 'max_period'. The test applies
    the seasonal decompose function to each seasonality period in the range and calculates the mean residual error for
    each period. The seasonal period that minimizes these residual errors is selected as the 'Best Period'. The results
    include the 'Best Period', along with the calculated residual errors and the determination of 'Seasonality' or 'No
    Seasonality'.

    **Signs of High Risk:**
    The following factors may indicate high risk or failure in the model's performance:

    - If the optimal seasonal period or 'Best Period' is consistently at the maximum or minimum limit of the provided
    range for a majority of variables, this might signify that the specified range doesn't adequately capture the true
    seasonality of the series.
    - A high average 'Residual Error' for the 'Best Period' could imply issues with the performance of the model.

    **Strengths:**
    This metric offers several advantages for time series dataset analysis:

    - It provides a robust, automated approach to identifying and quantifying the optimal seasonality.
    - It is applicable to multiple variables in a dataset, offering a comprehensive assessment of each variable's
    seasonality.
    - It uses concrete and measurable statistical methods to derive seasonality, enhancing the objectivity and
    reproducibility of the model.

    **Limitations:**
    There are also a few limitations of this metric:

    - Errors may arise if the time series exhibits random walk behaviour or lacks a clear seasonality, as the seasonal
    decomposition model may not be appropriate.
    - The defined range for the seasonal period (min_period and max_period) can influence the results. If the true
    seasonality period lies outside this range, this approach will not be able to identify the actual seasonality.
    - It may not fully interpret complex patterns that go beyond the simple additive model for seasonal decomposition.
    - The tool may infer seasonality where none exists if random fluctuations in the data match the defined seasonal
    period range.
