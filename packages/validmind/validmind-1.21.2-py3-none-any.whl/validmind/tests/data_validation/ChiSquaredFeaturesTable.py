    **Purpose**: The purpose of this metric, `ChiSquaredFeaturesTable`, is to perform a Chi-Squared test of
    independence for each categorical feature variable with a given target column. The Chi-Squared test is designed to
    determine if there's a significant association between the categorical features and the target variable. It is
    typically used in the context of Model Risk Management to comprehend feature relevance and identify potential bias
    in a classification model.

    **Test Mechanism**: This test involves creating a contingency table for each categorical variable and the target
    variable, and then performing a Chi-Squared test. The Chi-Squared statistic and the p-value for each feature are
    calculated using this method. The p-value threshold is a parameter that can be adjusted, and a test will pass if
    the p-value is less than or equal to this threshold. If not, the test will fail. The test result for each feature -
    consisting of variable name, Chi-squared statistic, p-value, threshold, and pass/fail status - is aggregated into a
    final summary table.

    **Signs of High Risk**: Red Flags for high risk include high p-values (greater than the set threshold) for certain
    variables. These high p-values suggest there is not a statistically significant relationship between the feature
    and the target variables, resulting in a 'Fail' status. If a categorical feature has no relevant association with
    the target variable, it can signal that the machine learning model may not be performing well.

    **Strengths**: This test allows for a thorough examination of the interaction between a model's input features and
    the target output, helping to validate the relevance of the categorical features. It also provides a clear
    'Pass/Fail' output for each categorical feature. The ability to adjust the p-value threshold adds flexibility to
    suit different statistical standards.

    **Limitations**: The metric assumes that the data is tabular and categorical, which may not apply to all datasets.
    It is specifically designed for classification tasks and not suitable for regression scenarios. It's also important
    to remember that the Chi-squared test, like any test based on hypothesis testing, is not able to identify causal
    relationships; it can only reveal associations. Moreover, the test relies on an adjustable p-value threshold, and
    different threshold choices may lead to different conclusions about feature relevance.
