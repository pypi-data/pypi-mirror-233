# Adelie

This repository contains research about group-lasso.
Specifically, we hope to consolidate all empirical studies about how group-lasso
regarding its performance based on different methods, literature overview, and application results
to decide which implementation/application makes most sense depending on the situation.

## Installation

MacOS users must have `OpenMP` installed in their system as a prerequisite.
The simplest method is to install with `brew`:
```
brew install libomp
```

Install the stable version with `pip`:
```
pip install adelie
```

For the bleeding edge version, follow the instructions in [Developer Installation](#developer-installation).

## Developer Installation

1. Install conda. We recommend installing `Mambaforge`, which is a conda installation with
`mamba` installed by default and set to use `conda-forge` as the default set of package repositories.

2. Clone the git repo:
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:JamesYang007/adelie.git
    ```

3. Set up `adelie` conda environment. The list of packages that will be installed in the environment
is in `pyproject.toml`.
    ```
    mamba update -y conda mamba
    mamba env create
    conda activate adelie
    poetry config virtualenvs.create false --local
    poetry install --no-root
    ```

4. Install `adelie` in editable mode:
    ```
    pip install -e .
    ```
