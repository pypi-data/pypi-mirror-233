Harnesses should *not* attempt to pepper this behavior over, or otherwise change the behavior of an implementation. In other words, this value should *not* be used to mutate incoming schemas (by inserting $schema). If an implementation does not support indicating what dialect a schema is written against unless indicated by $schema, or if it refuses to process schemas which do not contain $schema entirely, it should respond to this command as indicated below, and simply error when running cases containing such schemas as it would when used normally.
