# Install Dev Version

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/business-science/pytimetk.git
```

# Quickstart:

This is a simple code to test the function `summarize_by_time`:

```python
import pytimetk as tk
import pandas as pd

df = tk.datasets.load_dataset('bike_sales_sample')
df['order_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['order_date'])

df \
    .groupby("category_2") \
    .summarize_by_time(
        date_column='order_date', 
        value_column= 'total_price',
        freq = "MS",
        agg_func = ['mean', 'sum']
    )
```
