    Parameters
    ----------
    start_date : str or datetime or pd.DatetimeIndex
        The start date of the date range.
    end_date : str or datetime or pd.DatetimeIndex
        The end date of the date range.
    sunday_to_thursday : bool, optional
        If True, generates a sequence with Sunday to Thursday weekdays (excluding Friday and Saturday). If False (default), generates a sequence with Monday to Friday weekdays.
    remove_holidays : bool, optional 
        If True, excludes holidays (based on the specified country) from the generated sequence.
        If False (default), includes holidays in the sequence.
    country (str, optional):
