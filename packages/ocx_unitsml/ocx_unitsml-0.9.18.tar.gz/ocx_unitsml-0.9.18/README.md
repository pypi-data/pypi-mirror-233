# UnitsML XML unit markup schema 

## Introduction 
This schema was [originally developed and published by NIST](https://unitsml.nist.gov/).
The schema is used by the [OCX schema](https://github.com/OCXStandard/OCX_Schema) which is managed by the [OCX Consortium](https://3docx.org).
The UnitsML schema is publihsed by the OCX Consortium under the original [LICENSE](LICENSE).

## How to contribute
The schema file is maintained using an XML editor like Altova XMLSpy.
1. Installation: Simply download the schema files from the repository or clone it using git.
2. Create an [Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) for the proposed schema change. 
Follow [the recipe on the Wiki](https://github.com/OCXStandard/OCX_Schema/wiki) on how to register an issue.
3. Then create a branch from the issue, check out the branch and implement the proposed changes.
4. When the implementation is completed, create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).
4. The pull request will have to be approved by the [OCXStandard maintainer](https://github.com/orgs/OCXStandard/teams/ocx-schema-team?query=role%3Amaintainer) before it can be included in the working draft.

## Schema versioning
The UnitsML schema is following the Python [PEP 440 versioning recommendations](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/).

Following PEP 440, the canonical public version identifiers MUST comply with the following scheme:

``
  [N!]N(.N)*[{a|b|rc}N][.postN][.devN]
``
see the [PEP 440](https://peps.python.org/pep-0440/) for a detailed explanation.

## ``tbump`` versioning tool

The Python [``tbump``](https://pypi.org/project/tbump/) tool is used to automate and bump schema versions. ``tbump`` also provides the possibility for pre- and post-commit actions.
The project config file ``pyproject.toml`` contains the tbump settings.

### Usage

Assume that the current schema version is ``0.9.18``. To bump the schema version to a new version  ``1.0.0`` version, the following command can be issued:

<pre><code>
> tbump 1.0.0

</code></pre>


## Naive databinding
A set of Python dataclasses are autogenerated after each version release, see [databindings](databinding.rst)
