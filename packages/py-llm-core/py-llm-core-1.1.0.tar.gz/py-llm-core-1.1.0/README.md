# PyLLMCore

## Overview

PyLLMCore provides a light-weighted structured interface with Large
Language Models API.

The current version supports OpenAI API through the `openai` package.

![](./assets/example-1.png)

### What we do with this library ?

Use cases with examples are described hereunder, but basically you can :

- parse unstructured text and obtain Python objects (a populated dataclass)
- describe tasks for the LLM to perform (summarization, translation, ...)

### How to install

```shell
pip install py-llm-core

# Add you OPENAI_API_KEY to the environment
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-<replace with your actual api key>

```


## Use cases

### Parsing

When given unstructured content, LLMs are powerful enough to extract information and produce structured content.

We use a dataclass as a light-weighted structure to hold parsed data.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from llm_core.parsers import OpenAIParser


@dataclass
class Book:
    title: str
    summary: str
    author: str
    published_year: int


text = """Foundation is a science fiction novel by American writer
Isaac Asimov. It is the first published in his Foundation Trilogy (later
expanded into the Foundation series). Foundation is a cycle of five
interrelated short stories, first published as a single book by Gnome Press
in 1951. Collectively they tell the early story of the Foundation,
an institute founded by psychohistorian Hari Seldon to preserve the best
of galactic civilization after the collapse of the Galactic Empire.
"""


with OpenAIParser(Book) as parser:
    book = parser.parse(text)
    print(book)

# The results are :

Book(
    title='Foundation',
    summary="""Foundation is a cycle of five interrelated
    short stories, first published as a single book by Gnome Press in 1951.
    Collectively they tell the early story of the Foundation, an institute
    founded by psychohistorian Hari Seldon to preserve the best of galactic
    civilization after the collapse of the Galactic Empire.""",
    author='Isaac Asimov',
    published_year=1951
)
```

### Summary and advanced information extraction

We can use all the abilities to perform all kind of text processing with the
same class.

```python
from typing import List
import wikipedia  # Run `make test-setup` to install wikipedia package
from dataclasses import dataclass
from llm_core.parsers import OpenAIParser


@dataclass

@dataclass

text = wikipedia.page("Foundation from Isaac Asimov").content


with OpenAIParser(BookCollection, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-16k') as parser:
    book_collection = parser.parse(text)
    print(book_collection)


# The results are :

            author="Isaac Asimov",
            published_year=1988,
        ),
        Book(
            title="Forward the Foundation",
            summary="The final book in the Foundation series. It takes place eight years after Prelude to Foundation and explores Hari Seldon's final years as he works to establish the Second Foundation.",
            author="Isaac Asimov",
            published_year=1993,
        ),
    ]
)
```


## Question answering with Chain of Verification


```python
>>> from llm_core.assistants import COVQuestionAnswering
>>> cov_qa = COVQuestionAnswering.ask(
...     question="Name some politicians who were born in NY, New York"
... )
>>> print(cov_qa.revised_answer)

Some politicians who were born in NY, New York include Donald Trump,
Franklin D. Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt, and Andrew Cuomo.
```


## Performing tasks (summary, translations,...)

When a task should be performed by the language model, 
we add an explicit prompt (and system_prompt) to the desired structure.


```python
from typing import List
from dataclasses import dataclass
from llm_core.assistants import OpenAIAssistant


@dataclass
class SummaryWithInsights:
    system_prompt = """
    You are a world-class copy writer and work in broad domains.
    You help users produce better analysis of content by summarizing
     written content.
    """

    prompt = """
    Article:

    {content}

    - Summarize the previous content in approx. {word_count} words.
    - Provide a list key facts

    """

    summary: str
    facts: List[str]

    @classmethod
    def summarize(cls, content, word_count=100):
        with OpenAIAssistant(cls, model='gpt-3.5-turbo-16k') as assistant:
            return assistant.process(content=content, word_count=word_count)




import wikipedia  # Run `make test-setup` to install wikipedia package
text = wikipedia.page("Foundation from Isaac Asimov").content

response = SummaryWithInsights.summarize(text)

print(response)

# prints the following

    summary="""The Foundation series is a science fiction book series written

## Summarizing with Chain of Density Prompting

The following example implements the technique from the paper 
"From Sparse to Dense: GPT-4 Summarization with Chain of Density Prompting", Adams et al. (2023).

```python
from typing import List
from dataclasses import dataclass
from llm_core.assistants import OpenAIAssistant


@dataclass
class DenseSummary:
    denser_summary: str
    missing_entities: List[str]


@dataclass
class DenserSummaryCollection:
    system_prompt = """
    You are an expert in writing rich and dense summaries in broad domains.
    """

    prompt = """
    Article:
    
    {article}

    ----

    You will generate increasingly concise, entity-dense summaries of the above
    Article.

    Repeat the following 2 steps 5 times.

    - Step 1: Identify 1-3 informative Entities from the Article
    which are missing from the previously generated summary and are the most
    relevant.

    - Step 2: Write a new, denser summary of identical length which covers
    every entity and detail from the previous summary plus the missing entities

    A Missing Entity is:

    - Relevant: to the main story
    - Specific: descriptive yet concise (5 words or fewer)
    - Novel: not in the previous summary
    - Faithful: present in the Article
    - Anywhere: located anywhere in the Article

    Guidelines:
    - The first summary should be long (4-5 sentences, approx. 80 words) yet
    highly non-specific, containing little information beyond the entities
    marked as missing.

    - Use overly verbose language and fillers (e.g. "this article discusses") to
    reach approx. 80 words.

    - Make every word count: re-write the previous summary to improve flow and
    make space for additional entities.

    - Make space with fusion, compression, and removal of uninformative phrases
    like "the article discusses"

    - The summaries should become highly dense and concise yet self-contained,
    e.g., easily understood without the Article.

    - Missing entities can appear anywhere in the new summary.

    - Never drop entities from the previous summary. If space cannot be made,
    add fewer new entities.

    > Remember to use the exact same number of words for each summary.
    Answer in JSON.

    > The JSON in `summaries` should be a list (length 5) of
    dictionaries whose keys are "missing_entities" and "denser_summary".
