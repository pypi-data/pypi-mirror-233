Badger is a lightweight dag runner that comes with numerous features like dependency graph, interactive UI and many more. It allows users to run python programs as nodes of DAGs. Each node gets executed after it's dependencies are completed. Furthermore, failure of a node in the graph leads to failure of all further nodes.
