.. py:function:: create_gdsfactory_component_from_openlane(design_name_v1: str | None = None, design_directory: piel.config.piel_path_types | None = None, run_name: str | None = None, v1: bool = True) -> gdsfactory.Component

   This function cretes a gdsfactory layout component that can be included in the network codesign of the device, or that can be used for interconnection codesign.

   It will look into the latest design run and extract the final OpenLane-generated GDS. You do not have to have run this with OpenLane2 as it just looks at the latest run.

   :param design_name_v1: Design name of the v1 design that can be found within `$OPENLANE_ROOT/"<latest>"/designs`.
   :type design_name_v1: str
   :param design_directory: Design directory PATH.
   :type design_directory: piel_path_types
   :param run_name: Name of the run to extract the GDS from. If None, it will look at the latest run.
   :type run_name: str
   :param v1: If True, it will import the design from the OpenLane v1 configuration.
   :type v1: bool

   :returns: GDSFactory component.
   :rtype: component(gf.Component)


.. py:function:: gdsfactory_netlist_to_spice_netlist(gdsfactory_netlist: dict, generators: dict, **kwargs) -> hdl21.Module

   This function converts a GDSFactory electrical netlist into a standard SPICE netlist. It follows the same
   principle as the `sax` circuit composition.

   Each GDSFactory netlist has a set of instances, each with a corresponding model, and each instance with a given
   set of geometrical settings that can be applied to each particular model. We know the type of SPICE model from
   the instance model we provides.

   We know that the gdsfactory has a set of instances, and we can map unique models via sax through our own
   composition circuit. Write the SPICE component based on the model into a total circuit representation in string
   from the reshaped gdsfactory dictionary into our own structure.

   :param gdsfactory_netlist: GDSFactory netlist
   :param generators: Dictionary of Generators

   :returns: hdl21 module or raw SPICE string


.. py:function:: construct_hdl21_module(spice_netlist: dict, **kwargs) -> hdl21.Module

   This function converts a gdsfactory-spice converted netlist using the component models into a SPICE circuit.

   Part of the complexity of this function is the multiport nature of some components and models, and assigning the
   parameters accordingly into the SPICE function. This is because not every SPICE component will be bi-port,
   and many will have multi-ports and parameters accordingly. Each model can implement the composition into a
   SPICE circuit, but they depend on a set of parameters that must be set from the instance. Another aspect is
   that we may want to assign the component ID according to the type of component. However, we can also assign the
   ID based on the individual instance in the circuit, which is also a reasonable approximation. However,
   it could be said, that the ideal implementation would be for each component model provided to return the SPICE
   instance including connectivity except for the ID.

.. py:function:: convert_connections_to_tuples(connections: dict)

   Convert from:

   .. code-block::

       {
       'straight_1,e1': 'taper_1,e2',
       'straight_1,e2': 'taper_2,e2',
       'taper_1,e1': 'via_stack_1,e3',
       'taper_2,e1': 'via_stack_2,e1'
       }

   to:

   .. code-block::

       [(('straight_1', 'e1'), ('taper_1', 'e2')), (('straight_1', 'e2'), ('taper_2', 'e2')), (('taper_1', 'e1'),
       ('via_stack_1', 'e3')), (('taper_2', 'e1'), ('via_stack_2', 'e1'))]


.. py:function:: gdsfactory_netlist_with_hdl21_generators(gdsfactory_netlist: dict, generators=None)

   This function allows us to map the ``hdl21`` models dictionary in a `sax`-like implementation to the ``GDSFactory`` netlist. This allows us to iterate over each instance in the netlist and construct a circuit after this function.]

   Example usage:

   .. code-block::

       >>> import gdsfactory as gf
       >>> from piel.integration.gdsfactory_hdl21.conversion import gdsfactory_netlist_with_hdl21_generators
       >>> from piel.models.physical.electronic import get_default_models
       >>> gdsfactory_netlist_with_hdl21_generators(gdsfactory_netlist=gf.components.mzi2x2_2x2_phase_shifter().get_netlist(exclude_port_types="optical"),generators=get_default_models())

   :param gdsfactory_netlist: The netlist from ``GDSFactory`` to map to the ``hdl21`` models dictionary.
   :param generators: The ``hdl21`` models dictionary to map to the ``GDSFactory`` netlist.

   :returns: The ``GDSFactory`` netlist with the ``hdl21`` models dictionary.


.. py:function:: sax_circuit_permanent(sax_input: sax.SType) -> tuple

   The permanent of a unitary is used to determine the state probability of combinatorial Gaussian boson samping systems.

   ``thewalrus`` Ryser's algorithm permananet implementation is described here: https://the-walrus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/permanent_tutorial.html

   # TODO maybe implement subroutine if computation is taking forever.

   :param sax_input: The sax S-parameter dictionary.
   :type sax_input: sax.SType

   :returns: The circuit permanent and the time it took to compute it.
   :rtype: tuple


.. py:function:: unitary_permanent(unitary_matrix: jax.numpy.ndarray) -> tuple

   The permanent of a unitary is used to determine the state probability of combinatorial Gaussian boson samping systems.

   ``thewalrus`` Ryser's algorithm permananet implementation is described here: https://the-walrus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gallery/permanent_tutorial.html

   Note that this function needs to be as optimised as possible, so we need to minimise our computational complexity of our operation.

   # TODO implement validation
   # TODO maybe implement subroutine if computation is taking forever.
   # TODO why two outputs? Understand this properly later.

   :param unitary_permanent: The unitary matrix.
   :type unitary_permanent: np.ndarray

   :returns: The circuit permanent and the time it took to compute it.
   :rtype: tuple


.. py:function:: sax_to_ideal_qutip_unitary(sax_input: sax.SType, input_ports_order: tuple | None = None)

   This function converts the calculated S-parameters into a standard Unitary matrix topology so that the shape and
   dimensions of the matrix can be observed.

   I think this means we need to transpose the output of the filtered sax SDense matrix to map it to a QuTip matrix.
   Note that the documentation and formatting of the standard `sax` mapping to a S-parameter standard notation is
   already in described in piel/piel/sax/utils.py.

   From this stage we can implement a ``QObj`` matrix accordingly and perform simulations accordingly.
   https://qutip.org/docs/latest/guide/qip/qip-basics.html#unitaries

   For example, a ``qutip`` representation of an s-gate gate would be:

   ..code-block::

       import numpy as np
       import qutip
       # S-Gate
       s_gate_matrix = np.array([[1.,   0], [0., 1.j]])
       s_gate = qutip.Qobj(mat, dims=[[2], [2]])

   In mathematical notation, this S-gate would be written as:

   ..math::

       S = \begin{bmatrix}
           1 & 0 \\
           0 & i \\
       \end{bmatrix}

   :param sax_input: A dictionary of S-parameters in the form of a SDict from `sax`.
   :type sax_input: sax.SType
   :param input_ports_order: The order of the input ports. If None, the default order is used.
   :type input_ports_order: tuple | None

   :returns: A QuTip QObj representation of the S-parameters in a unitary matrix.
   :rtype: qobj_unitary (qutip.Qobj)


.. py:function:: verify_sax_model_is_unitary(model: sax.SType, input_ports_order: tuple | None = None) -> bool

   Verify that the model is unitary.

   :param model: The model to verify.
   :type model: dict
   :param input_ports_order: The order of the input ports. If None, the default order is used.
   :type input_ports_order: tuple | None

   :returns: True if the model is unitary, False otherwise.
   :rtype: bool


.. py:function:: fock_transition_probability_amplitude(initial_fock_state: qutip.Qobj | jax.numpy.ndarray, final_fock_state: qutip.Qobj | jax.numpy.ndarray, unitary_matrix: jax.numpy.ndarray)

       This function returns the transition probability amplitude between two Fock states when propagating in between
       the unitary_matrix which represents a quantum state circuit.

       Note that based on (TODO cite Jeremy), the initial Fock state corresponds to the columns of the unitary and the
       final Fock states corresponds to the rows of the unitary.

       .. math ::

   ewcommand{\ket}[1]{\left|{#1}
   ight
   angle}

       The subunitary :math:`U_{f_1}^{f_2}` is composed from the larger unitary by selecting the rows from the output state
       Fock state occupation of :math:`\ket{f_2}`, and columns from the input :math:`\ket{f_1}`. In our case, we need to select the
       columns indexes :math:`(0,3)` and rows indexes :math:`(1,2)`.

       If we consider a photon number of more than one for the transition Fock states, then the Permanent needs to be
       normalised. The probability amplitude for the transition is described as:

       .. math ::
           a(\ket{f_1}     o \ket{f_2}) =
   rac{    ext{per}(U_{f_1}^{f_2})}{\sqrt{(j_1! j_2! ... j_N!)(j_1^{'}! j_2^{'}! ... j_N^{'}!)}}

       Args:
           initial_fock_state (qutip.Qobj | jnp.ndarray): The initial Fock state.
           final_fock_state (qutip.Qobj | jnp.ndarray): The final Fock state.
           unitary_matrix (jnp.ndarray): The unitary matrix that represents the quantum state circuit.

       Returns:
           float: The transition probability amplitude between the initial and final Fock states.



.. py:function:: convert_2d_array_to_string(list_2D: list[list])

   This function is particularly useful to convert digital data when it is represented as a 2D array into a set of strings.

   :param list_2D: A 2D array of binary data.
   :type list_2D: list[list]

   :returns: A string of binary data.
   :rtype: binary_string (str)

   Usage:

       list_2D=[[0], [0], [0], [1]]
       convert_2d_array_to_string(list_2D)
       >>> "0001"
