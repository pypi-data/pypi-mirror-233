Thereâ€™s a list of awesome electronics projects `compiled by the CEO of

Selection of Python-to-HDL Flow
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

I am currently deciding which project to integrate as part of the
python-to-logic design flow. There are some cases where we might want to
generate some logic from some specific logical functionality. There are
several projects available, but not all with suitable enough
functionality:

I think going with Amaranth makes sense.
