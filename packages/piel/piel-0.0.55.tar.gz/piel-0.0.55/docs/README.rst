Microservices to codesign photonics, electronics, communications,
quantum, and more.

-  Free software: MIT license
-  Documentation: https://piel.readthedocs.io
-  Slack Channel: `Join #piel in open-source-silicon.dev <https://join.slack.com/t/open-source-silicon/shared_invite/zt-22rt521qo-C7HUHAXDJ~am33y9ZNOPlg>`__

Target functionality
--------------------

-  Co-simulation and optimisation between integrated photonic and
   electronic chip design.
-  System interconnection modelling in multiple domains.
-  Chip and interposer design integration.
-  Co-design components to circuits flow.
-  Maintain a multi-tool dependency design environment.

``piel`` aims to provide an integrated workflow to co-design photonics
and electronics, classically and quantum. It does not aim to replace the
individual functionality of each design tool, but rather provide a glue
to easily connect them all together and extract the system performance.

Examples
--------

Follow the many `examples in the
documentation <https://piel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples.html>`__.

Microservices Toolset
---------------------

This package provides interconnection functions to easily co-design
microelectronics through the functionality of the
`IIC-OSIC-TOOLS <https://github.com/iic-jku/iic-osic-tools>`__ and
photonics via `GDSFactory <https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory>`__.

Some existing microservice dependency integrations are:

-   `amaranth <https://github.com/amaranth-lang/amaranth>`__ - A modern hardware definition language and toolchain based on Python.
-  `cocotb <https://github.com/cocotb/cocotb>`__ - a coroutine based
   cosimulation library for writing VHDL and Verilog testbenches in
   Python.
-  `hdl21 <https://github.com/dan-fritchman/Hdl21>`__ - Analog Hardware
   Description Library in Python
-  `GDSFactory <https://github.com/gdsfactory/gdsfactory>`__ - An open
   source platform for end to-end photonic chip design and validation
-  `OpenLane v1 <https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane>`__ -
   an automated RTL to GDSII flow based on several components including
   OpenROAD, Yosys, Magic, Netgen and custom methodology scripts for
   design exploration and optimization
-  `OpenLane v2 <https://github.com/efabless/openlane2>`__ -
   The next generation of OpenLane, rewritten from scratch in Python with a modular architecture
-  `sax <https://github.com/flaport/sax>`__ - S-parameter based
   frequency domain circuit simulations and optimizations using JAX.
-  `thewalrus <https://github.com/XanaduAI/thewalrus>`__ -A library for
   the calculation of hafnians, Hermite polynomials and Gaussian boson
   sampling.
-  `qutip <https://github.com/qutip/qutip>`__ - QuTiP: Quantum Toolbox
   in Python

``piel`` also provides a common dependency-resolved environment for all these tools, so that you just get started with designing rather than manage dependencies (which is a massive pain). Full flow environment toolsets can use ``nix``, ``docker``, and some ``local`` installations following the existing open-source design flows.
