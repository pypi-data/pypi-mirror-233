Filters
=======
The Filters library provides an easy and readable way to create complex
data validation and processing pipelines, including:

- Validating complex JSON structures in API requests or config files.
- Parsing timestamps and converting to UTC.
- Converting Unicode strings to NFC, normalizing line endings and removing
  unprintable characters.
- Decoding Base64, including URL-safe variants.

And much more!

The output from one filter can be piped into the input of another, enabling you
to chain filters together to quickly and easily create complex data schemas and
pipelines.


Examples
--------
Validate a latitude position and round to manageable precision:

.. code-block:: python

   (
       f.Required |
       f.Decimal |
       f.Min(Decimal(-90)) |
       f.Max(Decimal(90)) |
       f.Round(to_nearest='0.000001')
   ).apply('-12.0431842')

Parse an incoming value as a datetime, convert to UTC and strip tzinfo:

.. code-block:: python

   f.Datetime(naive=True).apply('2015-04-08T15:11:22-05:00')

Convert every value in an iterable (e.g., list) to unicode and strip
leading/trailing whitespace.
This also applies `Unicode normalization`_, strips unprintable characters and
normalizes line endings automatically.

.. code-block:: python

   f.FilterRepeater(f.Unicode | f.Strip).apply([
       b'\xe2\x99\xaa ',
       b'\xe2\x94\x8f(\xc2\xb0.\xc2\xb0)\xe2\x94\x9b ',
       b'\xe2\x94\x97(\xc2\xb0.\xc2\xb0)\xe2\x94\x93 ',
       b'\xe2\x99\xaa ',
   ])

Parse a JSON string and check that it has correct structure:

.. code-block:: python

   (
       f.JsonDecode |
       f.FilterMapper(
           {
               'birthday':  f.Date,
               'gender':    f.CaseFold | f.Choice(choices={'f', 'm', 'n'}),

               'utcOffset':
                   f.Decimal |
                   f.Min(Decimal('-15')) |
                   f.Max(Decimal('+15')) |
                   f.Round(to_nearest='0.25'),
           },

           allow_extra_keys   = False,
           allow_missing_keys = False,
       )
   ).apply('{"birthday":"1879-03-14", "gender":"M", "utcOffset":"1"}')


Requirements
------------
Filters is known to be compatible with the following Python versions:

- 3.12
- 3.11
- 3.10

.. note::
   I'm only one person, so to keep from getting overwhelmed, I'm only committing
   to supporting the 3 most recent versions of Python.  Filters may work in
   versions not listed here â€” there just won't be any test coverage to prove it
   ðŸ˜‡

Installation
------------
Install the latest stable version via pip::

    pip install phx-filters


.. important::
   Make sure to install `phx-filters`, **not** `filters`.  I created the latter
   at a previous job years ago, and after I left they never touched that project
   again and stopped responding to my emails â€” so in the end I had to fork it ðŸ¤·

Extensions
~~~~~~~~~~
The following extensions are available:

- `Django Filters`_: Adds filters designed to work with Django applications.
  To install::

      pip install phx-filters[django]

- `ISO Filters`_: Adds filters for interpreting standard codes and identifiers.
  To install::

      pip install phx-filters[iso]

.. tip::
   To install multiple extensions, separate them with commas, e.g.::

      pip install phx-filters[django,iso]

Running Unit Tests
------------------
Install the package with the ``test-runner`` extra to set up the necessary
dependencies, and then you can run the tests with the ``tox`` command::

   pip install -e .[test-runner]
   tox -p

To run tests in the current virtualenv::

   python -m unittest

Documentation
-------------
Documentation is available on `ReadTheDocs`_.

If you are installing from source (see above), you can also build the
documentation locally:

#. Install extra dependencies (you only have to do this once)::

      pip install '.[docs-builder]'

#. Switch to the ``docs`` directory::

      cd docs

#. Build the documentation::

      make html


Releases
--------
Steps to build releases are based on `Packaging Python Projects Tutorial`_

.. important::

   Make sure to build releases off of the ``main`` branch, and check that all
   changes from ``develop`` have been merged before creating the release!

1. Build the Project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Install extra dependencies (you only have to do this once)::

    pip install -e '.[build-system]'

#. Delete artefacts from previous builds, if applicable::

    rm dist/*

#. Run the build::

    python -m build

#. The build artefacts will be located in the ``dist`` directory at the top
   level of the project.

2. Upload to PyPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. `Create a PyPI API token`_ (you only have to do this once).
#. Increment the version number in ``pyproject.toml``.
#. Check that the build artefacts are valid, and fix any errors that it finds::

    python -m twine check dist/*

#. Upload build artefacts to PyPI::

    python -m twine upload dist/*


3. Create GitHub Release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Create a tag and push to GitHub::

    git tag <version>
    git push

   ``<version>`` must match the updated version number in ``pyproject.toml``.

#. Go to the `Releases page for the repo`_.
#. Click ``Draft a new release``.
#. Select the tag that you created in step 1.
#. Specify the title of the release (e.g., ``Filters v1.2.3``).
#. Write a description for the release.  Make sure to include:
   - Credit for code contributed by community members.
   - Significant functionality that was added/changed/removed.
   - Any backwards-incompatible changes and/or migration instructions.
   - SHA256 hashes of the build artefacts.
#. GPG-sign the description for the release (ASCII-armoured).
#. Attach the build artefacts to the release.
#. Click ``Publish release``.
