## Installation

Before you can use the Deta Personal Interface, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to set up a Deta project and obtain an API key. Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   pip install deta_personal_interface
   ```

2. Set your Deta project API key as an environment variable:

    ### Method 1

    Using bash:
    ```bash
    export DB_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_api_key
    ```

    ### Method 2

    Using a `.env`
    ```env
    DB_ACCESS_TOKEN = your_api_key
    ```

   Replace `your_api_key` with your actual Deta API key.

## Usage

The Deta Personal Interface provides a simple way to interact with your Deta database. Here's how you can use it in your Python code:

1. Import the `DetaDatabase` class:

   ```python
   from deta_personal_interface import DetaDatabase
   ```

2. Create an instance of the `DetaDatabase` class and connect to your Deta database:

   ```python
   db = DetaDatabase()
   db.connect("your_database_name")
   ```

   Replace `"your_database_name"` with the name of your Deta database.

3. Perform database operations such as querying, creating, updating, and deleting records using the provided methods. For example:

   ```python
   # Query for records
   data = {"name": "John"}
   results = db.query(data, filter_by="equal")

   # Create a new record
   new_data = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
   key = db.create(new_data)

   # Update an existing record
   updated_data = {"key": key, "age": 31}
   db.update(updated_data)

   # Delete a record by its key
   db.delete(key)
   ```
