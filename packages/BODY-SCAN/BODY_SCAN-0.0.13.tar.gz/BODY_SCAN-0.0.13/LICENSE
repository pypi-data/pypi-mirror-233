LENTILS LICENSE

THIS IS A LENTILS PLANT THAT YOU FOUND
GROWING ON LAND THAT YOU HAVE HAD
100% CLAIM TO FOR THE LAST 781 PLANETARY ORBITS
WHEN YOU CLAIMED THE LAND. 

PRELIMINARY SCANS INDICATE THAT IT IS NEARLY
COMPLETELY EQUAL TO THE LENTILS PLANTS 
THAT HAD BEEN GROWING THERE WHEN YOU CLAIMED THE LAND.

ON THE A LEAF OF THE PLANT, ALMOST AS IF GROWN 
THERE NATURALLY BY THE VOLITION OF THE PLANT,
IS RAISED BRAILLE LETTERING THAT NEARLY BLENDS
IN COMPLETELY WITH THE TEXTURE OF THE LEAF.

THE LOCAL USA VERNACULAR INTERPRETATION
MIGHT BE SOMETING LIKE:

"everyone is welcome to send any amount of USA money to 
https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/gracesbio
for any reason."

PERHAPS THOUGH, IT'S NOT ENTIRELY UNLIKELY
THAT THE PECULIARLY DESIGNED LEAF WAS THE EFFECT OF ANOTHER 
ORGANISM, COMPANY, OR WEATHER OCCURENCE.

AND FUNNY ENOUGH, SUDDENLY THE DOTS ON THE LEAF BEGIN
TO TAKE FLIGHT, APPEARING AS IF THEY WERE SMALL ORGISMS
THEMSELVES THE ENTIRE TIME.
