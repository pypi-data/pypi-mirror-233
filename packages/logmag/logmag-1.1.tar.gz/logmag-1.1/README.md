Description:

Constants:
LOG_LEVELS: A dictionary mapping log level names to their corresponding numeric values. These values are used to determine the severity of log messages.LOG_COLORS: A dictionary mapping log levels to ANSI escape codes for colored output in the console.

Logger Class:
Logger: A class for handling logging. It has methods like log, debug, info, warning, error, and critical for different log levels.
Initialization Method (__init__):
The constructor (__init__) initializes a Logger instance with a specified name and log level (default is 'INFO').

Log Method (log):
The log method is a general method used by other log level methods to print log messages. It checks the log level and prints the message with a timestamp and color.
Log Level Methods (debug, info, warning, error, critical):
These methods are shortcuts for logging messages at specific log levels. They call the log method with the corresponding log level.

In summary, this code defines a simple logging system with different log levels and colored output for different levels. The Logger class can be instantiated with a name and allows logging messages at various severity levels.
