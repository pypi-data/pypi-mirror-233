# Welcome to consmodel library 👋

The library aims to provide a simple way to create individual consumer loads and generation. The main idea of the library is to be able to easily create consumption or generation power consumption profiles.

The library is a centralised modelling tool that implements the following consumption/generation consumptions:
   * pure consumption model,
   * solar plant model,
   * heat pump model,
   * electric vehicle modelling,
   * possibly other models...

The main idea of the library is to be able to easily create consumption or generation power consumption profiles.
