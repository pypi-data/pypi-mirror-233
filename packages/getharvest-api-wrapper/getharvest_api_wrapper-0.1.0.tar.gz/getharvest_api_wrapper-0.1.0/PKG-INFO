Description: # Python Harvest API Wrapper
        
        Yet another Python wrapper for the [Harvest API](https://help.getharvest.com/api-v2/) project management and time tracker application.
        
        This wrapper has incredibly humble goals, which are to support some specific API calls on some functionality to support a Harvest CLI application.
        
        No Oauth2, authentication is done by passing an API token and a user ID into the constructor. The constructor also requires a user agent to be passed down, as the wrapper is intended to sit as a library within a larger application.
        
        ## Basic usage
        
        ```python
        from getharvest_api_wrapper import HarvestAPI
        
        h = HarvestAPI("$USER_AGENT", "$ACCESS_TOKEN", "$ACCOUNT_ID")
        
        # Some basic functionality. Wherever the API specifies you can have query parameters in a GET request, you should pass in a dict of parameters. This can be empty.
        # For payloads for the POST and PATCH requests, you should pass in a dict of these parameters as well.
        
        my_project_assignments = h.get_active_project_assignments_for_current_user({}).json()
        
        response = h.update_user_assigned_teammates('$TARGET_USER_ID', {'teammate_ids': [1234, 5678]})
        
        ```
