# Aleo Python SDK

The Aleo Python SDK provides a set of libraries aimed at empowering Python developers with zk (zero-knowledge)
programming capabilities via the usage of Aleo's zkSnarks.

Currently this SDK is in alpha preview stage but it can current be run by running
```bash
bash install.sh
```

This will print out a simple aleo Private Key that is generated by the entropy present on your device.

## Future Work Planned
This SDK will be expanded to include the following features:
* Aleo Account Management
* Aleo program deployment, execution, and management
* Leo program compilation and execution

It is also planned to integrate this SDK with Aleo's ZkML Package so that the full suite of Aleo program execution and
account management capabilities can be used with ZkML.
