# Dinosaur Comic Metadata Processor

A set of tools for collecting various Dinosaur Comic metadata and compiling them into one JSON document.

It uses transcripts obtained using my other project, https://github.com/janek37/parse_qwantz.

## Installation

Install `qwantz-metadata` with `pip`

```bash
  pip install qwantz-metadata
```

## Acknowledgments

This program would not be possible without the wonderful comics by Ryan North!
