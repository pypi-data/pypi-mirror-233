## 0.1.0 - 2024-10-04

First official release of the `sspilib` Python module.
This includes both the high and low level API used for interacting with SSPI.
As well as Windows support, there is experimental Linux and macOS support using [sspi-rs](https://github.com/Devolutions/sspi-rs) as the SSPI implementation that ships with the wheels on those platforms.
