Crescendo provides a unified command line + API for training and evaluating Lightning models

</div>

------------

‚ö†Ô∏è **Crescendo is a work in progress and highly subject to change**

üôè Some of our boilerplate is based on the wonderful template by [ashleve](https://github.com/ashleve)! See [here](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template).

## Summary

‚≠êÔ∏è Crescendo leverages the power of [Hydra](https://hydra.cc), [Lightning](https://lightning.ai) and the humble command line to make executing the training of neural networks as easy as possible.

‚≠êÔ∏è Hydra supports an incredible suite of tools such as powerful approaches for hyperparameter tuning. These are built in and accessible.

‚≠êÔ∏è Loading your models will be handled with the `crescendo.analysis` API, so you can train your models via the command line on a supercomputer, then load the results in your local Jupyter notebook.

## Install

‚ö†Ô∏è **Coming soon!**

You can easily install Crescendo via Pip!

```bash
pip install crescendo
```

Of particular note, this not only installs the `crescendo` module, but also the `cr` command line executable. A simple example to test that everything is working properly:

```bash
cr model=mlp data=california_housing
```
