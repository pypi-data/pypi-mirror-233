Implemented logging methods (log, debug, info, warning, error, and critical) that allow to log messages with different log levels. These methods take a message and an optional level argument.
Defined a decorator_logger method that can be used as a decorator. It wraps a function and logs information about the function call, including its name, arguments, and keyword arguments.
Formatted log messages that includes the timestamp, log level, and the actual message.
Test.py is available to see implementation of logger.
