**sygnet** ("sigÂ·net") is a Python package for generating 
synthetic data within 
social science contexts. The **sygnet** algorithm uses cutting-edge advances in deep learning methods to learn the underlying relationships between variables in a dataset. Users can then generate brand-new, synthetic observations that mimic the real data.

### Installation
To install via pip, you can run the following command at the command line:
`pip install sygnet`

**sygnet** requires:
    
    numpy>=1.21
    torch>=1.10.0
    scikit-learn>=1.0
    pandas>=1.4
    datetime
    tqdm

### Example implementation

You can find a demonstration of **sygnet** under [examples/basic_example](examples/basic_example.ipynb).

### Current version: 0.0.13 (alpha release)

**Alpha release**: You should expect both functionality and pipelines to change (rapidly and without warning). Comments and bug reports are very welcome!

Replacing linear with sigmoid activation functions to facilitate better training, given automatic scaling of data to 0-1 space.
