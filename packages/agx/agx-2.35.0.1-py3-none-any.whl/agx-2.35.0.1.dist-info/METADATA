# AGX Dynamics

The purpose of this package is to enable other packages to depend on the the AGX Dynamics version that is installed and used locally.

## You should not install this package from pypi.org

Instead, after installing AGX Dynamics, do:

On Windows:

```cmd
setup_env.bat
pip install %AGX_DATA_DIR%/agx-pypi
```

On OSX, Linux:

```bash
source setup_env.sh
pip3 install $AGX_DATA_DIR/agx-pypi
```

You may now go ahead and `pip install` the package(s) depending on AGX. Pip versioning will make sure the correct one is installed.


## Why you should not install this package

AGX Dynamics will be available via pip, but until then:
