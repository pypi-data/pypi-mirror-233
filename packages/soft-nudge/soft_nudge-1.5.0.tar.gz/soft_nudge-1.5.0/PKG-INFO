# Soft nudge

![Example](https://github.com/80sVectorz/soft_nudge/blob/master/images/Example.gif?raw=true)

Soft nudge is a module with the goal to provide a reminder without the invasive beeps of conventional timers. I made it to solve a personal issue, but the code is free to use under the GPL-3.0 license.

# Original problem & usage example

Soft nudge was made to serve as a non-invasive reminder that would trigger every 20 minutes. In my case to remind me to look outside and give my eyes a break.

# Basic usage
You can find a simple overview of how to use this package [here](https://github.com/80sVectorz/soft_nudge/blob/master/BasicUsage.md).


# Disclaimer
**Soft nudge only supports windows.**
**The animation does not overlay on full screen programs that claim the screen and don't use the windowing system E.G. full-screen Minecraft.**

As this project was made for personal purposes first, it's probably not the cleanest code base.
Pull requests are welcome if you're willing to spend the time.
