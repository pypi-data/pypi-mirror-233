        Polls is a Django app to conduct web-based polls. For each question,
        visitors can choose between a fixed number of answers.
        
        Detailed documentation is in the "docs" directory.
        
        Quick start
        -----------
        
        1. Add "polls" to your INSTALLED_APPS setting like this::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                ...,
                "polls",
            ]
        
        2. Include the polls URLconf in your project urls.py like this::
        
            path("polls/", include("polls.urls")),
        
        3. Run ``python manage.py migrate`` to create the polls models.
        
        4. Start the development server and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/
           to create a poll (you'll need the Admin app enabled).
        
        5. Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/ to participate in the poll.
