# Introduction
## Probability Distributions
A probability distribution is a statistical function that describes all the possible values and likelihoods that a random variable can take within a given range.
This package includes two commonly used probability distributions, namely Gaussian distribution (or normal distribution) and Binomial Distribution.

# How to install 
you can install this package directly from the pypi repository using pip install: 
 `pip install Gaus_Binom_probability`
 
# How to import and use the package
Open `python` or in your main python code import Gaussian and/or Binomial distributions from the package and use them as follows:
- `from Gaus_Binom_probability import Gaussian, Binomial`

- The to make a Gaussian distribution you need to have the mean valu and the standard deviation value: 
	- `Gaussian(mean_value, stdev_value)`

- to read data that is generated by gaussian dist and to find their mean and stdev:
	- `gaussian_1 = Gaussian(mean, stdev)    #initialise your gaussian distribution`
	- `gaussian_1.read_data_file(Folder_address+filename) #read your data`
	- `gaussian_1.calculate_mean()    #to calculate the mean`
	- `gaussian_1.calculate_stdev()    #to calculate the stdev`
	- `gaussian_1.plot_histogram()    #to plot a histogram of your data`
	- `gaussian_1.pdf(x)    #to calculate the probability density function`
	- `gaussian_1.plot_histogram_pdf(number_of_data_points)    #to plot the normalized histogram of the data and a plot of the probability density function along the same range`
	- `gaussian_1 + gaussian_2    #to add two gaussian functions (meaning add means and update the stdev)`

- To make a bionomial distribution you need to have the probability of the occurence of your event (for example probability of getting head in coin flipping) and the number of your tries or the size of your data: 
	- `Binomial(probability_of_occurence, size_of_data)`

- to read data and to find their mean and stdev:
	- `binomial_1 = Binomial(p, n)    #initialise your Binomial distribution`
	- `binomial_1.read_data_file(Folder_address+filename) #read your data`
	- `binomial_1.calculate_mean()    #to calculate the mean`
	- `binomial_1.calculate_stdev()    #to calculate the stdev`
	- `binomial_1.replace_stats_with_data()    #to calculate p and n from the data set` 
	- `binomial_1.plot_bar()    #to plot a histogram of your data`
	- `binomial_1.pdf(x)    #to calculate the probability density function`
	- `binomial_1.plot_pdf(number_of_data_points)    #to plot the pdf of the binomial distribution`
	- `gaussian_1 + gaussian_2    #to add two Binomial functions (Note: p values of the two distributions should be the same.`
