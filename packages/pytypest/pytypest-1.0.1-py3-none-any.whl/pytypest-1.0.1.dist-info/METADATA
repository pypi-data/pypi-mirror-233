# pytypest

Type-safe and maintainable fixtures and parametrization for [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest).

Features:

+ 100% type safe.
+ Great IDE integration, go-to-definition always takes you in the right place.
+ Test parametrization that is readable even with many arguments.
+ Plug-and-play integration with pytest.
+ No vendor-lock, you can use only the features you need and don't touch the rest.
+ Fixtures can be cached, and you are in control of for how long.
+ Fixtures can accept arguments.

Check out [motivation](https://pytypest.orsinium.dev/motivation.html) if you want to know more about why this project was born.

## Installation

```bash
python3 -m pip install pytypest
```

## Usage

Fixtures are regular helper functions that `yield` their result and do teardown afterwards:

```python
from typing import Iterator
from pytypest import fixture

@fixture
def get_user(anonymous: bool) -> Iterator[User]:
    u = User(anonymous=anonymous)
    u.save()
    yield u
    u.delete()

def test_user() -> None:
    u = get_user(anonymous=False)
    assert u.anonymous is False
```

Compared to built-in pytest fixtures, these are explicit, type-safe, can accept arguments, support go-to-definition in IDE, and can be used as context managers. And like pytest fixtures, they are cached and can be scoped to the module or the whole session.
