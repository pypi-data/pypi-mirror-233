******************
Bugfixing to ensure that static queryjobs can be polled for all their results

Added:

    * Static queryjobs can now be queried for more than one segment
    

Changed:

    * Upon polling from a QueryJob it will now stall until it can poll data from Humio, ensuring that an empty result is not returned prematurely.

Removed:
