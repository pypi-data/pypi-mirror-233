# scCross
A Deep Learning-Based Model for integration, cross-dataset cross-modality generation and matched muti-omics simulation of single-cell multi-omics data. Our model can also maintain in-silico perturbations in cross-modality generation and can use in-silico perturbations to find key genes.  

Instructions, documentation, and tutorials can be found at:

## Overview
<img title="Model Overview" alt="Alt text" src="/figures/main.png">
Single-cell multi-omics provides deep biological insights, but data scarcity and modality integration remain significant challenges. We introduce scCross, harnessing variational autoencoder and generative adversarial network (VAE-GAN) principles, meticulously designed to integrate diverse single-cell multi-omics data. Incorporating biological priors, scCross adeptly aligns modalities with enhanced relevance. Its standout feature is generating cross-modality single-cell data and in-silico perturbations, enabling deeper cellular state examinations and drug explorations. Applied to dual and triple-omics datasets, scCross maps data into a unified latent space, surpassing existing methods. By addressing data limitations and offering novel biological insights, scCross promises to advance single-cell research and therapeutic discovery.

## Key Capabilities

1. Integrate more than three matched or unmatchd sinlge cell multi-omics datasets of totally different or partly same kinds of omics into one latent space which can be used in following downsteam analysis. The cell amount can be over 4 million.
2. Cross generate abitary two kinds of single cell data in training set to each other.
3. Simulate matched single cell muti-omics data of a special cellular status in arbitary kind of omics and arbitary amount.
4. Find key genes precisely in comparing two kinds of cell clusters via in-silico pertubation.
5. Effectively maintain genome changing when perturbating one omics and cross generating to to other omics.


## Installation


You may install scCross and its dependencies by the following command:

```
pip3 install git+https://github.com/mcgilldinglab/scCross
