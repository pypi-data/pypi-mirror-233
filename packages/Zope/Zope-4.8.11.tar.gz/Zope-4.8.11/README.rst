Zope 4 - the bridge between Zope 2 and Zope 5
=============================================

**Zope 4 has reached End Of Life status on 12/31/2022. All support has ended.
Please upgrade to Zope 5 as soon as possible.** The `Zope release
schedule <https://www.zope.dev/releases.html>`_ has details about support
policies and timeframes.

Zope 4 supports Python 2 and Python 3. It is meant to act as a bridge for those
upgrading applications from Zope 2. Once you are on Zope 4 and Python 3 the
next step to Zope 5 is painless and we recommend upgrading to Zope 5
immediately.


Installation
============

**Security warning:** The WSGI server Zope uses by default, waitress, was
affected by `an important security issue
<https://github.com/Pylons/waitress/security/advisories/GHSA-4f7p-27jc-3c36>`_.
Fixes were only released for Python 3.7 and higher. Therefore we strongly urge
you to either upgrade your Zope 4 installation to Python
3.7 or 3.8 or `switch to a different
WSGI server
<https://zope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operation.html#recommended-wsgi-servers>`_.
**If you are running Zope 4 on Python 3 we recommend you upgrade to Zope 5.**

Please visit the installation documentation at
https://zope.readthedocs.io/en/4.x/INSTALL.html for detailed installation
guidance.
