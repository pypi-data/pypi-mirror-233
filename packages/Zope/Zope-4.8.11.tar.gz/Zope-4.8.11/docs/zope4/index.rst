Zope 4
======

.. note::

    New installations should use Zope 5 instead of Zope 4. Users migrating
    applications from Zope 2 should upgrade to Zope 5 once their application
    supports Zope 4 on Python 3. The Zope developer community strives to make
    sure the next upgrade step to Zope 5 is and remains a quick and painless
    exercise.
