# BiocGenerics

> Generics for core BiocPy classes

I do not expect users to use this package directly at the moment. Developers who want to extend BiocPy's functionality can use this to support new data structures and experiments.

## Install

Package is published to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/biocgenerics/)

```shell
pip install biocgenerics
```
