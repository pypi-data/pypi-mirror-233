Ivy: a lightweight software bus
===============================

[Ivy](https://www.eei.cena.fr/products/ivy/) is a lightweight software
bus for quick-prototyping protocols.  It allows applications to
broadcast information through text messages, with a subscription
mechanism based on regular expressions.

This is the python implementation.  A lot of materials, including
libraries for many other languages are available from the [Ivy Home
Page](https://www.eei.cena.fr/products/ivy/).

Supported versions of python are: 3.7+

> **Note**: ivy-python v3.3 was the latest version supporting Python 2.7.
