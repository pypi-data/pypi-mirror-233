vagrant wheel install problems

from that link:
So it turns out that this problem was being caused by lag in Vagrant/Virtualbox's synced folders. I was trying to build the Python project inside a Vagrant VM shared from the host file system using a synced folder. Copying the project out of the synced folder into another folder in the VM allows it to build. Another dirty hack that worked was to add a time.sleep(1) in the setuptools/wheel.py source file on line 157 before the os.rename that was causing the OS Exception to be raised. This gives the file system a chance to sync, and therefore works around the issue.
