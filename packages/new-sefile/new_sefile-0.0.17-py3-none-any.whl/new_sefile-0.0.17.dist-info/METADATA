# Sefile CLI

![SEFILE](https://github.com/Kolong-Meja/search-cli/assets/90602095/6a57ad63-18a7-4ea6-8d37-e7ef07cafb7e)

Sefile CLI is a personal project created by Faisal Ramadhan or myself. This project was built using the Python programming language. At the time of its creation, this CLI was only useful for finding the desired file according to the initial directory, but over time I started adding several new commands, such as Create, Read, Write and Delete. All of these commands have their own purpose and function.

This CLI tool has available in https://pypi.org/ you can access it in https://pypi.org/project/new-sefile/ from there you can know how this CLI tool was made.

To install this CLI tool, you can simply type on your terminal or CMD:

```bash
python3 -m pip install new-sefile
```

To upgrade the CLI tool to the newest version, you can simply type on your terminal or CMD:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade new-sefile
```

> [!WARNING]
> To execute this package as a CLI tool, you must first registred the python $PATH for this package. So go check out your directory that save all of your python package. All operating system, has a different path where the python package saved, so search for it in Google first.

For Linux OS & Mac OS:

```bash
sudo nano ~/.bashrc
```

And now you are in .bashrc file, then add new line code, like:

```bash
export PATH="/home/(user)/(path)/bin:$PATH
```

Remember the (path) is different for every linux users, so from me is that you must search first where all you python package was saved. Then you can add new PATH into your python PATH, like above.

There are some different file names, that run executable dotfiles (.file) is your system, such as:

* .bashrc
* .profile
* .bash_profile
* .zprofile
* .zlogin
* .bash_login

So in my opinion, that you must search where the executable file that execute your python package.

For Windows OS:

> [!NOTE]
> For this operating system, i know you can do it by yourself, right?

## How to use it

It's quite easy, you just need to enter the command **sefile --help**, then you get the output like this:

![Screenshot from 2023-09-25 18-04-19](https://github.com/Kolong-Meja/search-cli/assets/90602095/d6fb2031-6c3c-4a78-84c8-58ee026e7448)

> [!NOTE]

## How to use it

It's quite easy, you just need to enter the command **python -m sefile --help**, then you get the output like this:

### How to show CLI version and information?

```bash
sefile --version
```

or

```bash
sefile -v
```

### How to find a file?

```bash
sefile find <filename>
```

or

> [!NOTE] 
> You can specify the initial directory path to find the file you want.

```bash
sefile find <filename> <path>
```

At first I created this based only on the filename, but eventually I added new flag options, namely --startswith and --endswith.

* **--startswith** flag is useful for searching files with your own custom prefix. Usage examples:

> [!NOTE] 
> **--startswith** flag has been set as **is_eager=True**, meaning this parameter will be executed and the main parameter will be overridden. Also, you need to input from what **(path)** you want to search file startswith **(prefix)**.

```bash
sefile find --startswith main
```

When you do this, the system will automatically look for files with a certain (in this case **main**) prefix from each directory or sub-directory that matches the initial directory.

* **--endswith** flag is useful for searching files with your own custome prefix. Usage examples:

> [!NOTE] 
> **--endswith** flag has been set as **is_eager=True**, meaning this parameter will be executed and the main parameter will be overridden.

```bash
sefile find --endswith .py
```

This flag has same functional as **--startswith** flag, but search file by the end name of the file that match with your custome prefix. Also, you need to input from what **(path)** you want to search file endswith **(prefix)**.

> [!NOTE]
> **--lazy** flag has been as **is_eager=True**, meaning this parameter will be executed and the main parameter will be overridden.

```bash
sefile find --lazy
```

This flag can be use if you to lazy to input CLI command. You only need to enter a special custom query, namely **find <filename> from <path>**. This custom query has same functionality as **sefile find <filename> <path>** command.

There are several input command you can do:

* find **(filename)** from **(path)**

for Linux OS: find main.py from /home/(user)/Documents

for Windows OS: find main.py from C:\Directory\SubDirectory

* find from **(path)** startswith **(prefix)**

for Linux OS: find file from /home/(user)/Documents startswith main

for Windows OS: find file from C:\Directory\SubDirectory startswith main

* find from **(path)** like **(prefix)**

for Linux OS: find file from /home/(user)/Documents like test

for Windows OS: find file from C:\Directory\SubDirectory like test

**NOTE**: You can also do **'quit'** or **'exit'** custom query in input field. This situation will needed if you want to **cancel** the find activity. So it makes more flexible for you to use **find** command

### How to create a file?

```bash
sefile create <filename>
```
> [!NOTE] 
> Default directory set as **/home/username**

or 

```bash
sefile create <filename> <path>
```

The system will automatically create a file with a certain file type (according to the type you add at the end of the file) in the directory you enter.

> [!NOTE]
> In newest update, there's one Options called **--project**. This useful for you if you too lazy for creating simple project. **Remember** this Options, will create **Python, Javascript, or Go** project, depends on your choice.

To run **--project** Options, you just simply write it in your terminal like this below:

```bash
sefile create --project
```

And you got this little thing:

```bash
What's project you want to create? 
 >  🐍 Easy Python                                                                                                                     
    👑 The king of Javascript                                                                                                          
    🐼 Cute Go                                                                                                                         
    ❌ Nah, i'm good         
What's the name of the 🐍 Easy Python project? my_api_project
Where do you want to save this my_api_project? /home/users/Documents
```

**NOTE**: You can do **'quit'** or **'exit'** command in input field. This command so useful if you are in the situation where you don't wanna input anything, or you do wrong input name in project name, or project directory, or when you choose the wrong project what you want to make.

In the newest update, i add another functionality for this create command. It's **--write** options. To using it, just simply type:

```bash
sefile create --write
```

![Screenshot from 2023-09-25 18-05-15](https://github.com/Kolong-Meja/search-cli/assets/90602095/85b9d585-8f73-4b59-9a1f-d84e2b5083fb)

It's automatically displaying Code Editor Interface in your terminal.

> [!NOTE]
> you need specifiy the Filename and Path first, before you do code or creating text.

So this write command, doesn't need ARGS at all, you just input command in your terminal above, and you can do code in your terminal.

**INFORMATION**:

So if you notice, theres is **'EXIT'** button and **'SAVE'** button right? the functionality of these 2(two) button are same as **'EXIT'** button and **'SAVE'** button in your code editor. 

You can exit whatever you want, but you can't save the code if you not input value in **'Filename'** and **'Folder Path'**. So be careful when you use this. 

### How to read a file?

```bash
sefile read <filename> <path>
```

or

* **--format** flag is especially useful for reading files of a certain type. Default file typer set as **text** or **.txt**. Example of the output:

**Example 1**:

Do this command in your terminal:

```bash
sefile read <filename> <path> --format python --indent --theme one-dark 
```

And you get a result like this in your terminal (**NOTE**: This is just example)

If you want to add indent for read code, you just simply add **--indent** or **-i**, you can just type like:

```bash
sefile read <filename> <path> --format python --indent
```

If you want to change theme also want to add indent, you can just type like:

```bash
sefile read <filename> <path> --format python --indent --theme monokai
```

All of theme that i add are:
* one-dark 		(dark theme)
* monokai 		(dark theme)
* dracula 		(dark theme)
* material 		(dark theme)
* gruvbox-light (light theme)
* lightbulb 	(light theme)

Or you can just type,

```bash
sefile read --help
```

For to know what all themes that available.

### How to remove a file?

```bash
sefile remove <path> <filename>
```
So you must input the path directory first then file that inside the directory.

In other hand, this command also has many options. The first one is **--startswith** or you just simpy type **-s**. To implement this command, you can type like:

```bash
sefile remove <path> --startswith <prefix>
```

> [!NOTE]
> For **--startswith** and **--endswith** options, it must required a prefix that related into this two options. For example, if you want to search file startswith something (depends on what value you inputed), you must use **--startswith**, but if you want to search file format endswith, let's say **.py**, then you must use **--endswith** options.

The second options is **--endswith** or you just simply type **-e**. To implement this command, you can type like:

```bash
sefile remove <path> --endswith <prefix>
```

The last one is **--subfolder** or you just simply type **-sf**. This options has functionality to remove sub folder and it's content from path directory target. To implement this command, you can type like:

```bash
sefile remove <path> --subfolder
```

## Keep in mind

This program is only useful for **find, create, read, write and remove**. Apart from that, I have nothing to add. I personally will only focus on the main command program, because there are still many things that can be updated in the future.
