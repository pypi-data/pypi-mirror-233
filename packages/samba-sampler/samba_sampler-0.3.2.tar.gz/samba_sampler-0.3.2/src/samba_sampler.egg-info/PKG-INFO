# SAMBA - Sampling Algorithms with Matrix-Based Weight Allocation

SAMBA is a Python package providing sampling methods via matrix-based distance measures to mitigate autocorrelation.

## Installation and Usage

The package can be installed via pip:

```bash
$ pip install samba_sampler
```

Detailed information on the usage of the package can be found in the [documentation](https://samba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
For a quick start, the following example shows how to use the package:

```python
import samba_sampler as samba
sampler = samba.LanguageSampler() # Default parameters
print(sampler.sample(5))
```

## Changelog
